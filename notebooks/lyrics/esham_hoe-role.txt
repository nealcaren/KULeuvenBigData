Listen up baby I need your undivided attention
I know you like to fuck so theres just somthin I should mention
All the guys call you fast but I call you slow
You say you see I'm a freak I say I see you a ho
But theres somthing your not telling but I already know
How you did it to Freddy and gave Eddie a blow
I say I'm ready to go now your ready to stay
Yesterday you tole me you was gonna gimme a play
Now your playin a game, I think it's really a shame
If you'd a said I was'nt gettin no pussy I wouldnt a came
You say your on the rag like I'm finna say dag
But I'll run up in it anyway I got my bodybag
You wastin my time, I could be blowin your mind
Or better yet you could be suckin or I'll fuck you from behind
It really dont matter because I'll splatter them guts
But right now I'm really feindin and I need to bust a nut
You dont gotta play that role, like I dont know
"What you talkin bout?" Bitch, I know you a ho
(CHORUS)
Why you tryin ta play that role when you a ho
Why you tryin ta play that role when you a ho
Ho's wanna act like they aint ho's
Then they stuff they ass in some skin tight clothes
Look at that cutie, big juicy booty
Got's to step to her and do my duty
Hey good lookin, whatcha got cookin
It looks like your virgin and ____?_____
I know you wont mind if I kick my lingo
You look like a ho, so I know you single
Pretty young thing, only seventeen
Walkin down the street just wanna be seen
Big ol earings, gucci links
By the way you switch your booty, betcha coochi stinks
Never ever have to worry bout your D-O-E
'cause the dumb ho still fuckin niggaz for free
My homeboy had a plan, to be her man
First he hit it and split it, got with it and then he ran
No need to play the role
'cause I already know...girl (whatcha talkin bout)
Bitch, I know you a ho
(CHORUS)
Why you tryin ta play that role when you a ho
Why you tryin ta play that role when you a ho
So I treat you like a ho, 'cause I know you a freak
You lick your lips and fingertips and still got nut on yo cheek
You say I treat you so bad
But bitch you make me so mad
Instead of suckin on my dick you'd rather fuck your dad
Everybody in the hood know that you aint no good
Go suck a dead mans dick and I know that you would
For a minute or two, you was fuckin the crew
Niggaz in and out your house you thought that nobody knew
Aint no shame in your game, only pleasure and pain
Said you like to gangbang and be the head of the train
So I treat you like you wanna be treated
That how I treat ya
Tie ya ass up with some ropa and then I beat ya
'cause I know you a freak inbetween the sheets
Gettin fucked like a ho seven days a week
So no need to play the role
'cause I already know, girl (whatcha talkin bout)
Bitch, I know you a ho
(CHORUS)
Why you tryin ta play that role when you a ho
Why you tryin ta play that role when you a ho
