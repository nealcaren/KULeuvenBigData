Nobody knows there's another I and another me
Nobody knows there's another sky and another tree
Say that you care, that you dare, that one day you will lose your grip
Nobody knows there's another I and another me
We're doing fine Minerva
We're doing fine
That's my rock'n'roll
No-one ever hears my stereo
Walkin' all night alone
No-one has ever told me where to go
