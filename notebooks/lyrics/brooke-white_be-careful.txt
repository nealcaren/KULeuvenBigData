I think about you
Far more than I think I ought to do
What in this world would I do
If I didn't have you around?
And I worry sometimes
When I have to leave you behind.
You're always in the back of my mind.
And every sigh,
Every sound
So all I want to say to you
Is I'm afraid to lose
The only one I care for
So be careful.
To have to fend for myself
Wouldn't be good for my health
I wouldn't do very well
Having to live without you
So keep up your guard
Look after your precious heart
And every time that we are apart
Remember I'm with you,
I'm with you.
So all I want to say to you
Is I'm afraid to lose
The only one I care for
So please be careful.
