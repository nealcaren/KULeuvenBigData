I had a dream
I had a dream I was flying over all of us
There were so many pretty people
So many pretty faces
I talked to some birds
I fell in love again
And none of this ever ended
Everything just kept going, and going and going
And even when you laughed, you cried
And even when you were sad you were really happy
Because you were here
And I got to meet every star, every planet
Everything that made me
And we all kissed
And became the same
We became the same
We became the same
Who would have thought this
We almost lost it
When you lie inside darkness it's hard to see
And we sleep in tradition
Keep them off in the distance
To tell you that I haven't been
We are all
Cold water
Why try at all?
Why bother?
Just hold me close my darling
Just hold me close my darling
Just hold me close my darling
Just hold me close my darling
Who would have dreamed this?
You couldn't mean this
It would be some type of meanness to where you are
'Cause I don't know where to go
And no one else seems to know
We are all
Night's fallen
Why try at all?
Dark callin'
So we're left alone
No one left to call upon
Be still now, broken bones
As I travel on just hold me close my darling
Just hold me close my darling
Hold me close my darling
Just hold me close my darling
So we're left alone
No one left to call upon
Be still now, broken bones
As I travel on just hold me close my darling
Just hold me close my darling
Just hold me close my darling
Just hold me close my darling
