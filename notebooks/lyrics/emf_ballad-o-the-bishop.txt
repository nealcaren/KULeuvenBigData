I've been out all night
I've been out drinking
What will you do
When you just can't see?
Will you break like a branch
Or will you stand like a tree?
Will you scream like the wind?
Will you stay in the breeze?
Are you crushed by my will
Or will you do what you please?
I've been out seeing the sunrise
I've been out thinking
What will you do
When you don't feel good?
Will you fall apart
Or will you do what you should?
Will you break your rules?
Will you make it right?
Will you just let go
Or will you put up a fight?
What will you do
When you can't stand still?
Will you make your move
Or will you just stay put?
Are you sad to be still
When there's places to go?
Can you keep it together?
Do you really, really know?
What's gonna happen
When it's do or die?
Will you face the truth
Or will you just let it lie?
Will you sail on through
Will you just get by?
Can you stand on two feet
Or will you just get high?
I've been out seeing the days in
I've been out drinking
