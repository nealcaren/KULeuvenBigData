Here we go again
Nothing ever changes
Same situation
I walk you through the stages
He's pulling on your heart strings
Making you change things
Your clothes, your friends
Messing with your head.
Tell me, how does he deserve your affection?
When there's so much more that I give to you
Tell me, how can I divide your attention?
Frustrating, can't take it
It's killing me, what can I do?
Put a gun against my head
Pull the trigger, hope I'm next
Beat me till I'm black and blue
Nothin' hurts as much as me not having you.
It feels like torture,
(It feels like) torture,
(It feels like) torture.
It feels like torture,
(It feels like) torture,
(It feels like) torture.
Tears are running down your face
You're cryin' on my shoulder
Every day's a battle
Fighting like a soldier
To break down the walls that are keeping me out
I gotta show you how I'm feel in now
Where's the justice in this mad situation?
I can find the words to speak the truth now
Tell me how I'm gonna win your affection
Frustrating, can't take it
It's killing me, what can I do?
Put a gun against my head
Pull the trigger, hope I'm next
Beat me till I'm black and blue
Nothin hurts as much as me not having you.
It feels like torture,
(It feels like) torture,
(It feels like) torture.
It feels like torture,
(It feels like) torture,
(It feels like) torture.
Can't you see the damage?
Your fallin' for his games,
You just keep running back girl
And it's driving me insane.
Put a gun against my head
Pull the trigger, hope I'm next
Beat me till I'm black and blue
Nothin hurts as much as me not having you.
It feels like torture,
(It feels like) torture,
(It feels like) torture.
It feels like torture,
(It feels like) torture,
(It feels like) torture.
It feels like torture,
(Taste his poison) torture,
(Feel it running through her veins) torture,
(Dry her tears that pour like rain) torture,
(Watch her just go back again) it feels like torture.
Torture (Taste his poison)
(Feel her pain)
(Feel it running through her veins)
Baby, don't you treat me this way
(Dry her tears that pour like rain.)
It feels like.
