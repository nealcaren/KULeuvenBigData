Blooming wildflower
I beg you, please tell me
Why do people fight and hurt each other?
Valiantly blooming flower
What can you see from your field?
Why can't people forgive each other?
The rain passed, and summer took on blue hues
All alone now
You trembled before me
Without saying a word.
When your friends wilt around you
What do you think?
With your leaves unable to speak
How do you convey love?
Summer's sun clouded over, the wind streamed by
The two overlapped.
I shall sing the proof that you lived
For the sake of those who have no names.
