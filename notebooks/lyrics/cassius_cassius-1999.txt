Cassius, it's over, Cassius away
Cassius, these day dreams, these day dreams, okay
Cassius, an accident
Cassius, an accident, accident, accident, accident
Cassius, it's over, Cassius, away
Cassius, these day dreams, these day dreams, okay
The lighthouse is an accident
The lighthouse is an accident, accident, accident, accident
I wish we'd gone
Wish we'd gone away
And what you've got
And what you've got is always gone away
Cassius, Cassius at best
It's all that we could do
It's all that we could do
The wind is in
The wind is in my heart
The wind is in
And what you've got is always gone away
Cassius, Cassius at best
It's all that we could do
It's all that we could do
Cassius, it's over, you're second best
Cassius, it's over, you're second best
It's over, you're second best
Second best, second best, second best
Cassius, it's over, Cassius away
Cassius, these day dreams, these day dreams, okay
The lighthouse is an accident
The lighthouse is an accident, accident, accident, accident
I wish we'd gone
Wish we'd gone away
And what you've got
And what you've got is always gone away
Cassius, Cassius at best
It's all that we could do
It's all that we could do
The wind is in
The wind is in my heart
The wind is in
And what you've got is always gone away
Cassius, Cassius is best
It's all that we could do
It's all that we could do
Cassius, it's over, you're second best
Cassius, it's over, you're second best
It's over, you're second best
Second best, second best, second best
I wish we'd gone
Wish we'd gone away
And what you've got
And what you've got is always gone away
Cassius, Cassius at best
It's all that we could do
It's all that we could do
The wind is in
The wind is in my heart
The wind is in
And what you've got is always gone away
Cassius, Cassius at best
It's all that we could do
It's all that we could do
