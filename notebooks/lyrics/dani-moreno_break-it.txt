Hear that sound, rocking all around
See the crowd shaking off the ground
Feel the freedom like nobody else
Feel the power of the universe
When the sun goes down gotta feel so fine
love is all around shaking up the ground
open up your mind gotta feel so fine
when the sun goes down
When the sun goes down gotta feel so fine
love is all around shaking up the ground
open up your mind gonna feel so fine
fly away....
Shake your body and break it !!!
Shake your body and break it !!!
A penny for your thoughts. why not drop it on some paper?
I will hold you close, cause I'm the great emancipator
The reason for my rhyme is not so hard to swallow
if you free your mind then your body must follow
Move, move >> Shake your body and move
nananananana
Move, move >> Shake your body and move
nananananana
Move, move >> Shake your body and move
nananananana
Move, move >> Shake your body and move
nananananana
Romy baby
Hear that sound rocking all around
Feel the freedom like nobody else
Feel the power of the universe
When the sun goes down gotta feel so fine
love is all around shaking up the ground
open up your mind gotta feel so fine
your way...
