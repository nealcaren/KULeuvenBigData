From an early age I was taught to respect
That a broken heart girl
Ain't a thing you collect
Close your eyes and say
Nothing lasts a day
You're wasting my time
Yet I love to love you
Close your eyes and say
Honour love obey
You're wasting my time
Yet I love to love you.
It's cold outside
The night love died
On the night you murdered love
It's cold outside
The night love died
On the night you murdered love.
January, February, March and April May
June July sees you go by
I see love walk away.
Didn't use a blade
A bullet or a gun
You poisoned the moonlight
It's cold outside
The night love died
On the night you murdered love
