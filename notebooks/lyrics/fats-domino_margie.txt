My little Margie
I'm always thinking of you, Margie
I'll tell the world I love you,
Don't forget your promise to me
I have bought a home and ring and everything
For Margie, you've been my inspiration,
Days are never blue,
After all I said and done,
There is really only one,
Oh Margie, Margie, it's you
