Have you ever, have you ever?
Have you ever been in love?
Have you ever, have you ever?
Have you ever been in love?
Before, before
Oh yeah, yeah
Before, before
Oh babe, yeah
To be in love is not a crime
So if you're not loving someone
You're wasting your time
Gotta know from my woman
Just the other day
I got to return on home
Come what may, 'cause
You're my sugar
See you're my honey
You're my sugar
In my bad day
You're my sugar
And you're my honey
You're my daddy
See you're my sugar, yeah
To be in love is not a crime, no
So if you're not loving someone
You're wasting your time
Gotta know from my woman
Just the other day
Say you got to return on home
Come what may, 'cause
I need my love and I need my squeezin'
Need my lovin' all night long
You need my lovin', need my squeezin'
You need my lovin' all night long
