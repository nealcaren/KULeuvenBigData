CHORUS:
When a butterfly flies by my window,
And I can see which way the wind blows.
Only you and I know,
You and I, butterfly.
Got a pillow under my mind yeah.
Believe that woman to be a cold mind yeah.
Come on curl up by the fireside.
[CHORUS]
(guitar instrumental)
Good ol Reverend Andrew came around.
Said Boy its good to see you back here in town.
Church on Sunday. Why dont you drop down?
The woman was lonely here when you were down.
Almost every day shed come by to see me.
Ill say a prayer tonight that you will be yeah,
Man enough to give her security,
Cause thats all that anybody really needs.
[CHORUS]
When a butterfly flies by my window,
And I can see which way the wind blows.
Only you and I know,
You and I, butterfly.
When a butterfly flies by my window,
And I can see which way the wind blows.
Only you and I know, know, know, know,
You and I, butterfly.
(Fantastic guitar fadeout)
