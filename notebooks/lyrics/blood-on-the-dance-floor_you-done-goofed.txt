"With everything going on in this world
All the people with hate in their hearts and minds...
And still the focal point is the lies about me
You've been blessed by fucking with someone
Who doesn't give a fuck what you say
But here's my message, hear me out,
I'm only saying this once."
I don't give a shit
about your insecurities
your attempts to get my attention doesn't bother me
but when you crossed that line
and dragged my name through the dirt
believe me girl
you're gonna feel all my hurt
I work hard for the things that are in my hands
my fans are what I love for,
It's my promised land
you seem to think
that the scene you've made
will somehow
some way
cause me so much pain
I don't think you understand
all your lies and shenanigans
won't make me give a damn
it's all just a fucking scam
So I'll keep on livin and keep on givin
we got one life to live
I won't be stopped with your fibbin
(CHORUS)
Everything You Said
It Was A Lie
We Watched As The World
Watched You Cried
Everything You Did
Was For The Fame
What You Have Now
Is A World Of pain
yeahhhhhh
Verse 2:
Hate,rage,lies, I'm done with it
I've let you fill my head with this shit
all because I'm living my dreams
and i never was taught to quit
i always swung back,
i never took the first hit
all the accusations,
and no truth to admit
I've changed how people think,
I'm not the only misfit
posting,blogging,hating with no reason to submit
Regardless of what you've read,
I've got no crime to commit
YOUR FICTION TRASH TALKING
IS DONE OUT OF HATE
but I'm about to murder it all,
I'm about to eradicate
look at me,
I'm beautiful,
not a suspect of rape
don't you know,I'm fucking boss?
read the fucking nameplate
your just a pawn of stupidity
you are a living mistake
I'm the king of the chessboard,so mother fucker,CHECKMATE
I am WRITING THIS FOR ANYONE WHO CAN RELATE
whose ever been hurt by the things that people say
I stand strong i don't let anything get in my way
I'm not going anywhere
maybe you'll see that one day
if i don't have anything,
and I'm left with nothing,
at least i still have my faith
That's all I need to embrace
(CHORUS)
Everything You Said
It Was A Lie
We Watched As The World
Watched You Cried
Everything You Did
Was For The Fame
What You Have Now
Is A World Of pain
yeahhhhhh
verse 3:
I won't be your prey
your wooden puppet on a string
you think your clever,
boldfaced lies control everything
you can call me fake
call me sick,
call me a nazi
I'll blow down your little house and cripple your posse
your victim I am not
I am a tiger
don't mess with me
I got the love of my fans AN MY FAMILY
they're the reason I am
they always cover my back
they'll annihilate your ass
when I'm under attack
this darkness I feel won't turn into a suicide
all your hate will push me right over to the golden side
and I'd love to think that when you talk to your shrink
he points out your the reason that your life stinks
and you're the cause for all this motherfucking bullshit
regret meeting me as your last dying wish
my name
and reputation won't be
the target of a slut
I'll be on top of the world
and you'll be cutting yourself fucked
(CHORUS)
Everything You Said
It Was A Lie
We Watched As The World
Watched You Cried
Everything You Did
Was For The Fame
What You Have Now
Is A World Of shame
yeahhhhhh
"When you're standing in the rain
And it's getting dark
It seems like the whole world is trying to bring you down
Remember
one love
one heart
BOTDF."
