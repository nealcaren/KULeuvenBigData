As you walked away
A strand of hair came undone
And was reflected in the sun
And everything was orange
As you disappeared
The shadow of death came undone
And was reflected in the sun
And everything was orange
They have begun to celebrate
The tidal wave they think is great
The ever-beating heart that it wasn't
They have begun
They have begun
They have begun
To assassinate the sun
As you died in the night
A million stars formed into one
And became another sun
And everything was orange
And now this horrible machine
Churns out pain instead of love
And looks just like the sun
And everything was orange
They have begun
They have begun
They have begun
To assassinate the sun
