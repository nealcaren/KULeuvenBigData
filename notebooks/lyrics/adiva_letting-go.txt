I didnt know
That it would be this hard
To let go of a love I wasnt sure I had
Didnt expect
For her to tell me
That I should move on and just leave this in the past
Pre-reff:
Well the problem is
Im not one for letting go of what I feel
And there were moments in the past
That I could swear that it was real
But now the truth is there was nothing
Just a childish fantasy
Although were best friends
I cant help feel thats not all I want to be
Reff:
Thanks for letting me know
There was nothing down this road
Although it hurts to hear
My future isnt quite so clear
The love that I still have
Is breaking my heart oh so fast
Cause honestly theres something I cant do
And its letting go of you
Verse:
All my life
I never thought that
When love was in my grasp Id have to let it go
I
Try not to break down
But all the sadness is slowly getting through
Reff:
Thanks for letting me know
There was nothing down this road
Although it hurts to hear
My future isnt quite so clear
The love that I still have
Is breaking my heart oh so fast
Cause honestly theres something I cant do
And its letting go of you
Bridge:
From the first time I met you I loved you
I cant stop thinking about you
How do you expect me to let you go?
