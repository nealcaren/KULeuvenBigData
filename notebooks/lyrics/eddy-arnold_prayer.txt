Prayer is a song we all can sing a light that the blind can see
Prayer is a gift the poor can bring however poor they'd be
Prayer is a star that lights the way for those who are in despair
And when your heart kneels down to pray God will hear your prayer
(Prayer is a song we all can sing
Prayer is a star that lights the way
