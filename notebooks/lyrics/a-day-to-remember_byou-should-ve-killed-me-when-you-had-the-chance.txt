So I say goodbye to a town that has ears and eyes
I can hear you whispering as I walk by
Familiar faces smiling back at me and I knew
This would make them change
The only thing that's going to bother me
Is that you'll all call yourselves my friends
Why can't you look me in the eyes one last time?
The writings on the wall, you've read that I'll be gone, but if you call my name
Just know that I'll come running, for one more night to spare with you
This is where I'm meant to be, please don't leave me
I've read these stories a thousand times, and now I'll rewrite them all
You're meddling in an anger you can't control
She means the world to me, so hold your serpent tongue
Is a whores lies worth dying for? I'll just take my time
The only thing that's going to bother me
Is that you'll all call yourselves my friends
Why cant you look me in the eyes one last time?
The writings on the wall, you've read that I'll be gone, but if you call my name
Just know that I'll come running, for one more night to spare with you
This is where I'm meant to be, please don't leave me
I walked into your house this morning
I brought the gun from our end table
Your blood was strewn across the walls
They'll find you on your bathroom floor when I'm done
But should I write it all off?
You should have killed me when you had the chance
