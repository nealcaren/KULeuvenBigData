She's high up on that Ferris wheel
Counting stars between the deals
Her neck is wrapped in cellophane
Just initials, not the name
Some tattoos come with funny stories like that
The poets call it bittersweet
And others call her frequently
The bruises hide under the jeans
With the lights out, no one sees
Her body's got a hundred stories like that
But when she's all alone, she's Marilyn Monroe
Waiting for Joe DiMaggio
To come and take her home
When she falls in love
She goes down but don't feel nothing
She falls in love and hits the ground
When she falls in love
She goes down but don't feel nothing
Girls like that don't fall in love
They just hit the ground, hit the ground
They just hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground
She'll kick it anytime she wants
She ain't no junkie dilettante
Her father was a minister
Who stood a little close to her
But I guess we all got funny stories like that
But when she's all alone, she's Marilyn Monroe
Waiting for Joe DiMaggio
To come and take her home
When she falls in love
She goes down but don't feel nothing
She falls in love and hits the ground
When she falls in love
She goes down but don't feel nothing
Girls like that don't fall in love
They just hit the ground, hit the ground
They just hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground
She's high up on that Ferris wheel
But this time she can't seal the deal
She only needs it one more time
After that she'll be alright
But I just can't think of any story like that
When she falls in love
She goes down but don't feel nothing
She falls in love and hits the ground
When she falls in love
She goes down but don't feel nothing
Girls like that don't fall in love
They just hit the ground, hit the ground
They just hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground
When she falls in love
She goes down
When she falls in love
She goes down
When she falls in love
She goes down but don't feel nothing
Girls like that don't fall in love
They just hit the ground
