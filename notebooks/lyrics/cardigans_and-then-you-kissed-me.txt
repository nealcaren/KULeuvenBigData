Man I've had a few
But they wouldn't quit blow me like you
You gave me your name and sight
With a halo around my eye
And it hits me like never before
That love is a powerful force
Yes it struck me that love is as bored
So I pushed you a little bit more
Love, you're news to me
You're a little bit more then I thought you'd be
A mow in my well fed lawn
You're a nightmare beating the dawn
Oh it hits me like never before
That love is a powerful force
Yes it struck me that love is a sport
So I pushed you a little bit more
Blue, blue, black and blue
Red blood sticks like glue
True love is cruel love
Red blood say power fuel
Sweet love tasty blood
My heart overfloods
Oh you hit me
Yeah you hit me really hard
Man you hit me
Yeah you hit me right in the heart
Lord I've had my deal
But I never quite knew how it feels
When love makes you wake up soar
With fists that are ready for more
And it hits me that love is a game
Like in war no one can be blamed
Yes it struck me that love is a sport
So I pushed you a little bit more
Blue, blue, black and blue
Red blood sticks like glue
True love is cruel love
Red blood say power fuel
Sweet love tasty blood
My heart overfloods
Man you hit me
Yeah you hit me really hard
Baby you hit me
Yeah you punched me right in the heart
And then you kissed me
And then you hit me
Oh you hold me with your violent heartbeat at night
Oh you strike me with your silence baby tonight
Why you hold me with your violence baby come hit me
You hold me with your violent heartbeat
