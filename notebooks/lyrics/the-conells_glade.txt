Anyday, your gonna to throw it all away
see you got it just throw away
now here you wind
how its coming in from all sides
you got it coming
riding in on you
this is what we should do
lets go to boy island
book a passage
for a few days in sun
waiting and watching for girls to come
waiting, watching
You know
you came up with it too long ago
see it happened
so long ago
how could you know
lets go to boy island
book a passage
for a few days in sun
waiting and watch for girls to come
waiting, watching
waiting, watching for girls to come
waiting, watching
Everyday
you've got to throw it all away
see you got it, just throw it away
that's what I might say
lets run to boy island
book a passage
for a few days in sun
waiting and watch for girls to come
waiting, watching for girls to come
waiting, watching
just like mary waits in the sun
just like mary waits in the sun
waiting, watching for girls to come
waiting, watching
Boy, oh boy...
