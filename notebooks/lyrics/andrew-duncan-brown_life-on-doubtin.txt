Well I spend my life on doubtin
Spend my time on the rope
And Ive learned Im scared of those things that help me grow
So I took myself to the liquor store
And I drove my heart to the dump
So I drank those sauced up nights and down I go
I was walkin up to my getaway van
Out the faded window of a faded man
And I was shaken and I was beaten and I was fightin my soul
Cause I been drivin to where I dont know
So I go to sleep for dreamin and I stay awake to forget
And I shut my eyes and reap what I sow
So I spend my life on doubtin
And I spend my time on the ropes
And Ive learned Im scared of those things that been a helpin me grow
So I go to sleep to dream
I stay awake to forget
I been shutting my eyes and reaping just what I sow
So I was walkin up to my getaway van
Ive been out the faded window of a very faded man
And I was shaken. I was beaten, and I been fightin my soul
And I been drivin to where I just dont know
