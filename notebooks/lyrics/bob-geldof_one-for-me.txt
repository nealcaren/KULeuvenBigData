You`re a lotta laughs ain`t you babe
You cracked me up, I laughed so much I nearly died
It`s so funny I was weeping
Cried so hard, I nearly split my side
I watched you laughing on the TV
I don`t get it said the kindly host
But there are many here among us
Who feel the sight is but a joke
Your imagination`s running riot
Sometimes I swear you believe what you say
No-one seems to notice it`s the same joke
It`s just told in a thousand different ways
And I can`t wait to read the new ones
Yeah the comedy just gets better every day
You`re a lotta laughs ain`t you babe
It`s funny how it all turned out that way
Ooh, you should have known better
You should have known better, a-ha-ha
It`s not for you, this one`s for me
It`s not for you, this one`s for me
I saw a picture of you grinning
Yeah that smirk covered your entire face
It almost split your head in two
I hear you sold it to OK
Sell a photo of you laughing
The more you hoot the more they pay
You don`t even need to get your clothes off anymore
You`re a bit too old for that stuff anyway
Somebody saw you at the party
You did the one where you`re falling flat on your face
You had the whole place cracking up in stitches
Apparently you fall with such good grace
And the teenage clothes and see-through sizes
The mutton dishes up on the Sunday plate
Is now the lamb in ghostly guises
It`s all done in the best of taste
Ooh, you should have known better
You should have known better, a-ha-ha
It`s not for you, this one`s for me
It`s not for you, this one`s for me
