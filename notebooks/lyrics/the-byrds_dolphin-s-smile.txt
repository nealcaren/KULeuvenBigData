Out at sea for a year
Floating free from all fear
Every day blowin' spray
In a dolphin's smile
Wind-taut line split the sky
Curlin' crest rollin' by
Floating free aimlessly
In a dolphin's smile
Rainbow's end everywhere
Full of life, free as air
Childhood's dream, have you ever seen
A dolphin's smile?
