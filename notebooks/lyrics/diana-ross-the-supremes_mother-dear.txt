Something's on my mind
Mother dear the boy keeps me crying
Don't know which way to turn
Keeps me so confused
Keeps me so confused
Mother dear
'Cause for him I yearn
But he treats your daughter bad
Keeps your daughter sad
I wish I didn't love him so
'Cause now I can't let him go
His kiss gets a little sweeter
Ooh, my heart gets a little weaker
I'm falling deeper
Deeper in love each day
I know he's no good for me
But I'm too weak to break away
Ooh, each day love gets a little stronger
Ooh, heartaches lasts a little longer
Help, help me mother dear
'Cause I can't help myself
Ooh, he treats your daughter bad
Keeps your daughter sad
So many times I've tried
Telling him we're through
But when he takes me in his arms
There's nothing I can do
Ooh, it's no use
I can't break loose
I keep love him more and more each passing day
All my love to him I give it
Without him around
I couldn't live
I need him so
And he knows it
Can't let him go
And I show it
Help, help me mother dear
I'm so in love with him
But he treats your daughter bad
Keeps your daughter sad
Help, help me mother dear
Help, help me mother dear
He keeps your daughter crying
