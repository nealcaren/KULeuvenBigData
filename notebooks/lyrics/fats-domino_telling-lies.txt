You've been telling me lies and I know it
There's no love in your eyes 'cause it's showing
'Cause every time I hold you in my arms
You just lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
You said you wanted me for your honey
But all you wanted was my money
You didn't even try to make me satisfied
You just lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
You know you made me love you
When your rolled those great big eyes
Although I didn't know it
They were only stirring up lies
You've been doing me dirty and you hide it
I know I can't leave 'cause I've tried it
So just as long as you hold me in your arms
You can lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
You know you made me love me
When your rolled those great big eyes
Although I didn't know it
They were only stirring up lies
You've been doing me dirty and you hide it
I know I can't leave 'cause I've tried it
So just as long as you hold me in your arms
You can lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
