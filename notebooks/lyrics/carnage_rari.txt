I just bought me a Ferrari
I just bought me a Ferrari
I just bought me a Ferrari
I just pulled up in a Rari
Fucked a little bitch in a Rari
My diamonds they blind you, I'm sorry
Ferrari, Ferrari
I just bought me a Ferrari
I just pulled up in a Rari
My diamonds they blind you, I'm sorry
Ferrari, Ferrari

My diamonds they blind you, I'm sorry
Ferrari, Ferrari

I just pulled up in a Rari
My diamonds they blind you, I'm sorry
[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
I just got me a Ferrari
Black with the wood-grain like Atari
I don't eat no calamari
Always on my VLONE like I'm Bari
Ride around through the safari
With Dex tryna catch us a body
(You know...fuck on bad bitches, you know
Big booty bitches, that's how we do)
I'm the one they want after party
All these other rapping niggas sorry
One fifty, skrrting on the E-way
Tired of giving these niggas leeway
Ain't a nigga that gon' check Boat, nah, not never
Twenty-five hundred for my sweater
Got these bitches thinking I'm clever
How you doing?

[Verse 2: Famous Dex]
I just pulled up in a Rari
I'm sippin' on lean not Bacardi
These bitches they text me "I'm sorry"
Baby girl are you retarded?
My diamonds they blind you, I'm sorry
I'm busting off, I'm flexing on the mollies
These bitches they geek in the lobby
I'm thinking they wanna have a party
I can't have an ink on my body
Bitch I be balling like Bobby
My thirty issue like Scotty
Taking off like a rocket
Now the bands in my pocket
Smoking dope, who's to stop me?
All these bitches say "I'm sorry"
I just bought me a Rari

[Verse 3: Ugly God]
I'm Ugly God
My dick is little
My neck is musty
But I'm fucking bitches
I'm in poverty
My J's fake
But all these hoes still fucking with me
I'm disrespectful
I'mma steal your girl just to grab her ass and then rub her titties
I'm an ugly nigga
I know this shit
But my dick game still bubblelicious
Ugly God squeeze on your bitch in the closet
Ugly God got your bitch wet like a droplet
Ugly God make your bitch drip like a faucet
Ugly God melt your bitch heart like some chocolate
