(Verse 1: Chamillionaire)
Slow loud and bangin man I'm the man
I never been ya fan and I ain't never been
a stan
Sayin I'm the man cause I told you that I am
super poked
swangas
you can check my wingspan
I don't mess with ya'll man I'm anti-social
I don't talk too much I'm anti-vocal
Ya'll ain't goin nowhere your anti-coastal
And ya'll ain't gettin no mail your anti-postal
Speakers sounding like a marching band
Laws hoping that my pockets full of contraband
Boys thinking bout plotting when I park my
lam
I'm a spray you cockroaches like the orchid man
Looking so regal, hoping outta
regal
Not the birdman but I'm riding with a eagle
I don't know who the hell telling you that I need you
They got you gassed up girl I hope your using diesel
Whoa kimosabee
, groupies in the lobby
Flying outta hobby like flying is a hobby
Boys wanna rob me, go ahead and try me
I own way more heat than pat riley
Your girlfriend reccomend that I molest her
u.f.h
I shoulda been a professor
Open up my wallet and pretend I'm a test her
She turnin in paper like it's end of semister
living la vida loca
Come at me wrong I'm at cha neck like a choker
When I recline I'm sitting in it like a sofa
Drive it once then I give away the vehicle like oprah
Chauffer, mr. belvadere that's the butler
Told ya, let her disappear never cuff her
Rolla, money everywhere in my duffle
Hold up, I can't even hear that's my muffler damnn
Loud pipes got me sounding super sexy
Blades everywhere make your woman think I'm wesley
Ask the police when they gonna come arrest
If I do a crime it will be the day they catch me
Rims sitting high you can call me high roller
Ice on both wrists you can call me bi polar
Go against me you should know your life over
Your girl going crazy you should know that I drove her
Manage the wheel, they know cham is fo real
Now that I am independant they gon panic fo real
From the land of the trill before they hand me a deal
I will slap that boy with a backhand full of bills
Getting that cabbage that's bein established
In the new crib where the layout is lavish
Money jurassic
amex is blackness
Naked lady standing like she straight out a pageant
Haters you should go get yourself a razor
Look at your wrist and go and do yourself a favour
Watch the one time the police il try an taze ya
Pistol jam on me I'm a switch it up and blade ya
You don't know me you can diss away
ain't waiting till tomorrow I'm a trip today
Stop acting like you hard ya'll should switch to gay
Ya'll boys sweeter than a lemonade or chick fillet, ay
(Bridge: Chamillionaire)
Got to come down got to be the damn best
Jewellery gon shine that il be on my chest
Rain or sunshine I admit that I'm fresh
And ya already knowing what I rep, yep
I was always on grind while them other boys slept
Money on time better not be a dime less
Gotta bunch of dimes and they hit me on texts
Just to tell me that I always bein the best yes, I'm the best
(Verse 2: Chamillionaire)
Gotta touch down and show my ends on skillz
But when I touch down it's probbly in brazil
Diamonds on froze so my wrists on still
Never on safety my 4 5th on kill
See me out there she tried to get my address
Plenty hoes pose and change clothes like pageants
Headboard that's in my bedroom is so padded
Plenty dope lines for these hoes like tablets
Tongue that stay stuck on my gold it's so icy
Tongue it'll stay stuck on my pole the ho like me
Haters back at home ain't made enough to come fight me
I'm in new york sitting court side like I'm spike lee
Always winning like I'm bryant with four lakers
Gotcha woman sippin hennessey with no chaser
Everytime I see em that chamillion hold paper
Got her sayin koopa what the hell is your safe for
Got these boys sayin that she mines and don't touch her
Then she tell you to stop cryin and don't cuff her
I convince a girl to strip down with no muscle
Went out to the a and took a dime to know usher
Went out to the lou and took a dime to know nelly
Went out to the chi and took a dime to know kelly
Plus the chick that say she cool with drake was so ready
But none of em can trip cause they know they so petty
panamera
Gettin plenty knowledge like she taking me to school
Say I don't go hard they gon say that you a fool
It's gon hit you like blaow when I hit you with the tool
