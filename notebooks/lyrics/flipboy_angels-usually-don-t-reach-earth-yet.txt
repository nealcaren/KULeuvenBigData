[ Intro ]
Audrey, you're a beautiful and amazing person,
You really are, I see it and I feel it,
I'm not saying you're perfect, nobody's perfect,
I'm just saying that I see the true beauty in you
that I've never saw in another person before,
So I just want to let you know how I feel about you. Just listen...
[ Verse ]
When I first saw you, I never thought we'd be together,
I expected no friendship, connection or even be lovers,
Who ever thought one day you would have love for me?
Who ever thought one day we'd have a love story?
Girl, I wanna be the one who makes you reach the highest star,
I wanna be the one who heals and cures all your scars,
I wanna cheer you up and make you glad when your sad,
I just wanna be the best man you've ever had!
[ Chorus x 2]
You know these words are true to you, girl, I would never lie,
I treasure your heart, can I keep you and make you mine?
I wanna hold you tight, I wanna hold you close,
I wanna let you know that I love you so!
