with a mouth full of fresh flowers
you woke up the neighbors
no one could have told you
your body would fail you
silent as the star
it broke you like a song
I heard the party's here
have I only come to
watch through your window
float up through the ceiling
softly escaping
drag you to the ground
you stood there alone
I heard the party's here
