It is he
Christ who is born today
Hear him crying
In the manger
King of Heaven
Son of God
Alleluia, Alleluia
There he lies
There with the lambkin
Only swaddle for his garment
With his Holy Mother Mary
Alleluia, Alleluia
Glory, Glory to almighty God
And on earth peace to all men
Hear the joyful angels singing
Alleluia, Alleluia
He is born
Let us adore him
Christ the Lord
King of Kings
Prince of Peace
For all the universe
Alleluia, Alleluia
