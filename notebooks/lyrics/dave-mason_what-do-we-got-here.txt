She don't claim to be the perfect one
And I don't claim to be Sir Lancelot
We ain't sure when we're positive
It's likely that we'll sit here scratching our heads
She don't say that she loves me
And I don't send her no flowers
What do we got here?
What do we got here?
We've got something I'm not sure of
It ain't likely but I think they call it love
Well I think they call it love
She don't climb no trees for me
And I don't tell her she should
We don't sneak around or step on toes
