Smoke
Lingers 'round your fingers
Train
Heave on - to Euston
Do you think you've made
The right decision this time?
You left
Your tired family grieving
And you think they're sad because you're leaving
But didn't you see the Jealousy in the eyes
Of the ones who had to stay behind ?
And do you think you've made
The right decision this time?
You left
Your girlfriend on the platform
With this really ragged notion that you'll return
But she knows
That when he goes
He really goes
So do you think you've made
The right decision this time?
