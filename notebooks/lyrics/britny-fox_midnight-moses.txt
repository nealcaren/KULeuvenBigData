Hey, hey, hey, hey
Underneath the green veranda
Singin' love songs for mad Maranda
They call me the midnight Moses
Everything I touch is coming up roses
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Tell me where I'm going
I got no way of knowin'
I wish I was a forest ranger
Danger, danger, danger
Hey, hey, hey, hey
I had an afternoon fever
And when I flew out to Geneva
I just took me a notion
To fly right across the ocean
