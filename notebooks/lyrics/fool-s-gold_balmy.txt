Release me into the dream of an opposite air
Release me into the dream of an opposite air
It possesses me
It caresses me
It possesses me
It caresses me
Oh, will I be left over?
Or, will I remain here?
Your voice it fills the sea of this alternate earth
Your voice it fills the sea of this alternate earth
It possesses me
It caresses me
It possesses me
It caresses me
Oh, will I be left over?
Or, will I remain here?
