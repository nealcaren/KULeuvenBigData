When I rest
When I lay down
I got to call on you.
When I sleep
When I don't wake up
I got to call on you.
Don't let me hide, Don't take away me pride
Remind me of everything that I don't wanna know
Speak to my heart
Help me make a start
Don't leave me out here with nowhere to go.
When I'm lost
When I'm blind
I got to call on you.
When I cry
When I break right down
I got to call on you.
Don't leave me blind, don't leave me behind
Don't leave me here to dream my life away
I'm out in the rain
And this world's insane
Don't leave me here to waste another day.
