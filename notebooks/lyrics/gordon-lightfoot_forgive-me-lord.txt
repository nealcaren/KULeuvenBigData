Make my world a better place to be
Remove these chains and set me free
Give my life one reason to begin
Forgive me lord for I have sinned
Take my hand and lead me as you choose
It seems we ain't got much to lose
Give this place one season without shame
Forgive me lord I've sinned again
I been down on my luck, as a matter of fact
I've even been chaste
Drifting along, singing a song
For the whole human race
I been caught in the act, as a matter of fact
I'm even well known
Floating on by with a laugh and a sigh
On the road that leads home
I got no more time left to roam, if you love me
Take this world and build it as you please
With a little help from the likes of me
Keep it safe from harm and make it pure
Forgive the rich and save the poor
Like the dust on the wind I've been taken again by my foolish pride
Drifting along, singing a song, that's how I get by
I been caught in the act, as a matter of fact I've even been chased
Floating on by with a laugh and a sigh for the whole human race
I got no more time left to waste, if you love me
Make my world a better place to be
Remove these chains and set me free
Give my face a different point of view
Forgive us lord if we run to you
If you love me
Make my world a better place to be
Remove these chains and set me free
Give my life one reason to begin
Forgive me lord for I have sinned
Give my life one reason to begin
Forgive me lord for I have sinned
