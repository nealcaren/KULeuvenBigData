Veins on leaves
A cat of kings
A mouthful of seed
A strand of beads
An hour of lust
A bucket of trust
It's time to rest
My shiny things
Pull them off
Pull them off
Pull them off of me
Little one, please don't cry
Shiny things you just can't buy
Trying to fix
Isn't broken
Letting dust
Inside old swings
Turning to rust
My shiny things
Pull them off
Pull them off
Pull them off of me
Little one, please don't cry
Shiny things you just can't buy
Trying to fix
Isn't broken
Locked in dust
Insect wings
Turning to rust
My shiny things
Turning to rust
My shiny things
Pull them off
Pull them off
Pull them off of me
Little one, please don't dry
Shiny things you just can't buy
Bonkers at Phoenix
You never know, though, eh? eh?
That Glastonbury
Would all people who want
Vegetarian burgers go on the left
And those who want meat burgers on the right
Car parking is available at Glastonbury Phoenix
Out of the back
You see me
Naughty wicker man, oogie man
You see me, oogie man
M. Riley
You mood swing
And from the day
Angles with you
Bonkers at Phoenix
