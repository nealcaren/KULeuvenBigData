Skin,
it's your guard, it's your defender
To
what's inside, from an outsider
A shelter for home, a cover for cold
A love to hold a heart of gold
Stay close to me
Know you'll always be home
A place where you can
Show off all your bones
We'll shed our skin
So fair, so young
I'll be the air
To fill your lungs.
I feel it every day
A constant will to defend
Sinking ships at bay
Broken wings will mend
If you feel alone inside of your skin
I'll be your bones, I am your home
There's always more to give when it comes to you.
I'd bring you the skies if you'd ask me to.
There's no holding back
From here on in you're golden, my sin
You let me breathe again.
