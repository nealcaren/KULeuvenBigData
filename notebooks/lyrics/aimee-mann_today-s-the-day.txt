Better pack your bags and run Or stay until the job is done Baby you could sit and hope That providence will fray the rope And sink like a stone Or go it alone And isn't it enough for you Isn't it enough? Isn't it enough for you For you... Isn't it enough? So better pack your bags and run Where you don't look like anyone And do what you do Send it to oblivion Till it buries you That anyone would care about And isn't it enough for you Isn't it enough Isn't it enough Isn't it enough for you Like Major Reno on the bluff And isn't it enough? Wondering aloud if help is on the way And baby isn't this your chance To make a break with circumstance Isn't it enough to prove today's the day? And isn't it enough to prove today's the day?
