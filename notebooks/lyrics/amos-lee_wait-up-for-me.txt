When you cannot get to sleep at night
Taunted by that new daylight
When you just can't sleep before the morn
And you do not feel reborn
Wait up for me
Wait up for me
I'll be coming home
So you don't have to be alone
When you're lost out in this world
And you feel you've come undone
You ain't nobody's little girl
You ain't nobody's sacred son
Wait up for me
Wait up for me
I'll be coming home
So you don't have to be alone
Well I'm ragged too
Just like you
I might not show it
But I feel it inside
Well I'm ragged too
Lost and blue
Feeling like a little
Child
Lately I've been thinking of
All the losin' that I've done in love
The wind she steals my sweet caress
Please feel me in your emptiness
Wait up for me
Wait up for me
I'll be comin' home
So you don't have to be alone
Wait up for me
Wait up for me
I'll be comin home
So you don't have to be alone
