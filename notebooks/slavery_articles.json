Mr. Wicksteed was present at\nboth meetings, and spoke at ooin , out ne\nwas alone in his glory. Not a Methodist\nnor a Daptist, not an Independent nor s\nChurchman, was there to keep him compa\nny. I am told that at other towns it has been\nverv much the same. At Darlington an In\nj ... . i . - j .. j\ndependent minister, ftir. rrucnaru, ancnuuu,\nbut it was to oppose the abolitionists, and\ndefend the pro-slavery and slave-holding\nchurches and preachers. At Newcastle an\nIndependent minister attended ; but it was to\ndefend tho faithless Editor of the Christian\nWitness, the traducer and calumniator of the\nslaves' best friends. Generally speaking,\nthe orthodox ministers throughout the coun\ntry have kept aloof from the cause of aboli\ntion. To such an extent has this been the\ncase, that George Thompson, at a meeting of\nthe League in one of our large towns, when\nasked, 'Is this an anti-slavery meeting, or an\nanti-clerical meeting V was obliged to an\nswer, ' It is truly, and in good faith, a pure\nly anti-slavery meeting ; hut lam sorry to\nsay,' that such is tho position, and suc-h is tho\nconduct of the clergy, than an anti-slavery\nmust now of necessity be an anti-clerical\nmeeting.'\nThe conduct of orthodox ministers in this\nmatter requires explanation. This explana\ntion we atlcmpt to give. Many are asking,\nWhy were there no ministers at the meetings\nat Leeds This question we attempt to an\nswer. Whether our answer be the right one,\nour readers must judge. We fear it is. We\ngrant that our answer condemns the minis\nters ; but we nave no nope mat uie ministers\nwill be able to prove that we have con\ndemned them unjustly. In a part of\nthis tract we speak as in the name, of the\nministers; but with no desire to do them\nwrong. And we have no\" desire that our\nanswer to the question should be the only\none; if the ministry will answer tor them\nselves, we shall bo glad to read their answer.\nWe have answered the question to llie nest\nof our ability, and we hope that botli minis\nters and people w ill receive proht, it not plea\nsure, from what we have written.\nWhy, then, did Ministers of the Town of\nLeeds absent themselves from the Anti-Slavery\nMeeting on Thursday evening last?\nan\nnot\nbut,\nrea\nits\nand\none\nthe\nthey\nperson\nnot.\nwho\ndevil\nhave\nAnd\nan\nand\na\nand\nend,\nin\nwith\nwhose\nthe\nAns. 1. It was not because they are in\nfavor of American Slavery. It was not be\ncause they have any objection to tho aboli\ntion of slavery. It was not because uiry\nthink that slavery is a natural or a happy\nf tate for man. It was not because they think\nthat slavery in America is better than the\nslavery once existing in the West India Is\nlands, it was not because tney are wisinui\nlo perpetuate slavery in America. On the\ncontrary, they would rejoice to see slavery\nabolished. 1 hey would bo glad to see me\nworld entirely free from such an unnatural\nand inhuman system. They regard slavery\nas the greatest curse of humanity. They look\nupon it as a mass ot crime, lliey believe\nwith John Wesley, that it is the grossest\noutrane upon human nuhts mat can be per\nnetrated. the bitterest insult to a Human De-\niii rr that can be olfered, and the sum of all\npossible villages. They are perfectly aware\nthai slavery must necessarily be a system\ncruelty that cruelty and slavery are insepa\nrable. They are aware, that to subdue\nspirit of a human being, to reduce him to\nbrute, and to hi mm to be useo as property,\nthe greatest cruelties imaginable are neces\nsarv. Thev are aware that slavery is a sys\ntem of stripes, ol cliains, oi letters, oi\nyokes, of brandings, of maimings, of insults,\nof indignities, of violence in every form,\nof cruelty in every shape, they are aware\nthat slavery is inconsistent vvitn respect\nthe institution ot marriage, witn tne sacreu\nness of domestic relationship, with the vigour\nand health of the benevolent affections,\nwith all the dear delights and joys of home,\nof love, and household blessedness. They\nare aware that slavery is a system of pollu\ntion ; that where slavery prevails, woman\nunprotected, and subject to every indecency\nand outrage. They are aware that where\nslavery prevails, the husband is torn from\nwife at his master's pleasure, and the\ntorn from her husband ; that children are\nfrom their parents, and parents\ntheir children that beauty, and innocence,\nand all the attractions of humanity, are bought\nand sold, by selfish, sensual, brutal man\nThey are aware, that in me lamine oi\nslave-holders, as well as in the huts of\nslaves, the grossest licentiousness prevails,\nand the most unnatural anominauon.\naro nol ijnoiant of tho fact, (hat the piobl\nteresting portion of the human species, are\noften reared and trained for the most inhu-\nman and revolting purpose that the mind of\nman can conceive. They are not even ig\nnorant of the fact, that where slavery pre\nvails, the father often sells his own offspring,\nand in some cases sells his offspring to the\nu.uo. ,iu. nme ana unnatural doom lo which\na human being can he devoted. Then\nalso iware, that slavery is destructive to the\niineiemn oi morality in general. They know\nthat it hardens the heart of the Blave-holder,\nand makes the injured slave reckless and\ndesptrate. They know that it increases\nmen 8 selfishness ; that it withers the very\nroot cf benevolence, and makes the heart of\nthe master as hard and unfeeling as a stone.\nThey know that absolute power was never\nmeant for man, and that no man can possess\nit without risk or ruin lo his virtue and his\nhumanity. They know that to deal in the\nblood and flesh, in the bodies and souls of\ntheir brethren that to seize and make mer\nchandise of those whom God has formed for\nintelligence, and virtue, -and immortality,\nmuBt necessarily strike at the root of all that\nis good, of all that is great, of all that is ten\nder, of all that is god-like, of all that is love\nly, of all that is Christ-like in the human\nsoul.\nThe ministers of Leeds are also aware.\nthat the existence of slavery in America, must\nnecessarily havo an injurious effect upon the\ninterests of other nations of the earth. Thev\nhave been given to understand, that the rights\ncf Dritons themselves are already sacrificed,\nin part, to the interests of that unholy and\nunnatural institution. They have also dit\ncovered that those who hold men in slavery,\nmust necessarily seek to keep instruction\nfrom the slaves. They are aware that the\nAmerican slave-holders deny their slaves the\nliberty to learn to read and write that in the\nslave States of America it is made death by\nlaw, to attempt a second time to teacli the\nslaves to learn the letters of the alphabet, or\nto spell the name of God their Father in\nheaven. The ministers of Leeds have also\nbeen given to understand, that where slave\nry prevails, it necessarily generates a spirit\nof bondage or servility in the minds of the\nwholo community, and exerts its baneful in\nfluence both on church and state, corrupting\nand enslaving the minds of all. They are\naware that in the Slave Stales of America the\nof\na\niron\nand\ntor\nand\nis\nhis\nwife\nse\nparated from\nma\nthe\nijr\nin-\nnolitical representatives of the Slate are bound\nto tho defence and advocacy of slavery at all\nhazard, and that the ministers of the various\nreligious denominations are tiod and bound\nin like manner, to connive at the abomina\nti.ans 4 that system, and lo refrain from re\nbuking its guilty upholders. \" They are\nthat slavery has corrupted the churches\nof America that members, and leaders, and\ndeacons, and elders, and preachers, nnd bish\nops, end churches, are involved in the guilt\nof slave-folding that members and minis\nters of churches are to be found brecdingand\nrearing slaves for the market, and selling,\nand buying, and whipping, and branding\ntheir fellow-creatures as their daily occupa\ntion that they even buy, and sell, and whip,\nand brand, the members of their own chur\nchesthat Methodists are found holding Me\nthodists in slavery, and Baptists holding D ip\nlisls in slavery, and Independents holding In\ndependents in slavery ; that ministers are\nlound dealing in llie nesn anu uiooo, in me\nbodies and souls of their own church mem\nbersthat churches even in their corporate\nenpacily ore found in possession of slaves\nthat missionary societies, ana uiuie socieues,\nand religious seminaries and colleges are\nsupported bjT the price of human beings;\nsupported, not only by Ihe forced earnings.\nor the plundered wages oi tno siayes, our uy\niho price received at public auction for the\npersonB of the slaves. I say that with all\nthese things the ministers of the town\nI.ecLS are, to somo extent at leasi, acquain\nted. They have read the reports of nnli-\nslavory speeches in tho newspapers. Some\nof them have read the narrativo of Frederick\nDouglass ; and those who have not heard In\nsneak, have heard accounts of his speeches\nfrom those who have attended his lectures,\nand have read reports of his speeches in the\nnewspapers published in their own town.\nThey are acquainted therefore with the groat\nfacts connected with American slavery.\nThey are aware lhat in the United States\nAmerica there are three millions of their fellow-creatures\nheld in the most abject and\nnmnl hnmlnire. Thev are aware that\nnumber of slaves is annually increasing that\nthe extent of territory occupied by slavery\nannually enlarging that Texas has been\nwrestpd from Mexico to be convertod from\nland of freedom into a land of slavery\nil,o United States are wacing war with\nMexico at this moment, tor the purpose\nwresting from lhat power still greater tracts\nof territory, and of converting California\nNew Mexico into slave plantations. They\nare aware too that America obstructs llie\nof England and othor European powers,\nin their efforts to put down the slave-trade,\nand to secure freedom and peace to the wide\nspread population of Africa.\n1 say me mimsiern ui\nall these things ; and they are wishful\nat least we are required to believe them wish\nful, that Ihose great evils should bo brought\nto an end. It was not then because\nwere ignorant of the evil of slavery ; it\nnot because they were ignoran eexn\nto which slavery prevail. -\n. , .i.ou i-ro indifferent to\nnot Decaubr,\nindifferent to\narowth of this frightful evil ; .1 was not\nthey are wishful lo perpetuate\nstreng he Ibis most awful of all vices,\nmostBterrible of all calamities, that the mm\nUten of Leeds chose to keep away from\nmeetings of the Anti-Slavery League.\nWhat then was the reason\nWe answer, secondly, ihe ministers\nnot absent themselves from the mee ings\nh. Anti-slavery League because they\nthe agenls of the League to be drun\nken. profligate, licentious men. or mer ,\nare seeking their own interests by the\nofSnti-slaver, principle, t nor w..\nbecause they considered the agents o t\nAnti-slavciy League to be men of weak\ntellects or feeble powers; persons ignorant of\nthe subject on which they presume to speak,\nor unable to present the subject in its true\ncolors before the meetings which they ad\ndress. On the contrary, they regard the a-\ngents of the league as men of virtue and res\npectability; as persons of intelligence and\ngreat abilities. I'hry know that they under\nstand the subject on which they speak, and\nthat they are able to make that subject un\nderstood by others. They know, that both\nas speakers and as writers, they are persons\nof superior powers ; men that can both exhi\nbit truth to the understanding, and make it\ntell by the heart, llipy know, that the pre\nsident of the league, George Thopmson, is a\nman oi unequalled powers, as well as a man\nof high character. They know that the se\ncretary too, if they are acquainted with him,\nis a man of virtue and integrity, nnd of no\nordinary abilities as a speaker. They know\nthat the agent of the league, Frederick Doug\nlass, is a man both of extraordinary talents,\nand of a sterling, irreproachable character\nthat his spirit, hi3 language, his powers, all\ncombine to render him an object of intense\ninterest and of liMi admiration. The min\nisters of Leeds are also aware, that Frederick\nDouglass comes to them accredited by the\nfavorable testimonies of some of the most\nrespectable, intelligent, and pure-minded in\ndividuals, both in America, in Ireland, and\nin Great Britain. It was not therefore for\nwant of satisfactory information with respect\nto the general character and the superior la I\nents of the agents of the Anti-slavery League\nit was not for want of a knowledge that\nthe agents of the league were respectable, in\ntelligent individuals, disinterested, philan\nthropic characters, that the ministers of Leeds\nabsented themselves from the meeting on\nThursday evening. What then was the rea\nson 1\nWe answer ; the ministers of Leeds were\nafraid lest the advocacy of the rights of the\nslave, by the agents of the league, should in\njure the interests of religion t should endan\nger the stability of their religious denomina\ntions, and exert an unlavorable influence upon\nthe credit and position of the ministers them\nselves. The ministers of Leeds have learn\ned from various sources, that the anti-slavery\nlecturers charge a great deal of the guilt of\nslavery, upon the churches and ministers ol\nAmerica. They have learned that they con-\nof\nof\nthe\nis\na\nthat I\not\nand\nef\nforts loo,\nthey\nwas\nsidcr the American churches and American\nministers, as the cliisf supports of slavery\nThey have been informed that ono of the ad\nvocales of the cause of the slave, has pub\n1'ished a work entitled ' The American Chur\nches the Bulwarks of American Slavery\nThey have learned wilh dismay, that Wright\nand Douglass, and Garrison, are prepared\nrisk the existence ol any lurm ol religion mat\njustiiies slavery, ot any church that upholds\nslavery, and of any ministry that connives\nslavery. They have learned with dismay,\nthat Wright, and Douglass, and Garrison, are\nbent upon the overthrow of slavery at all\nhazards that they are prepared to risk the\n07erthrow of every church, of every religious\nsystem, of every religious sect, that stands in\nthe way ol the lull and speedy abolition ot\nslavery. One of these men, II. C. Wright,\nthey havo learned, has declared himself rea\ndy to put bis heel upon any government that\ngives its B.inction to slavery ; to pul his heel\nupon any religion that sanctifies slavery ;\nput his heel upon every institution that is\nwar with the freedom and rights of any por\ntion of the human family. They have found\nthat in speakinrr nirainst slavery, those lec\nturers expose the guilt of the American chur\nches, and of the American ministers that be\nfore mixed nnd crowded audiences they un\ncover tho nakedness of their slave-holding\nreligious brelhrrn, and their beloved slave\nholding and slavery-advocaling fellow minis\nters across the Allaniic lhat they make\nknown to the people of England the awful\nfact, that the churches and ministers of Ame\nrica generally are pro-slavery, and that many\nof them are actually engaged in tho traffic\nslaves that Methodist ministers, ISaptist\nministers, Independent ministers, Presbyte\nrian ministers, and Episcopal ministers, are\nall implicated in the guilt of slave-holding,\nand in all the cruellies and abominations\nconnected with the slave system. These\nlecturers have attempted to make it plain,\nthat before slavery can be abolished in Ame\nrica, those slave-holding churches must\nthoroughly revolutionised, or utterly destroy\ned. They have endeavored to mane uie\npression on the minds of iho people of Eng\nI land, that the Mothodist, and Baptist,\nPresbyterian and Independent denominations\nI of this counlry, are in fellowship wilh\nslave-holding churches and ministers of Ame.\nrira, and are thus partakers of their crimes\nThev have published it to the world as\nfact, that the Melhodist churches of England\nare in fe owslun Willi tho slave-holding\nihndist churches of America that the\nil.n.liji Conference places the numbers\nIhe Blave-holdiug Methodists and slave-holding\nministers of America, upon theirminutes,\nand reckon them as part of their own body,\nand hold fellowship wilh them as truly Chris\ntian men. They have published it to\nworld that the Methodist ministers cf\nwhen they have gone over to America,\nhave neglected, or refused, in their public\nsermons, lo denounce the slavery of Ameri\nca, and to rebuke their slave-holding brelh\nern.

They are concerned for ths\ncause of tiod, or for Ihe interest of their re\nepective denominations. They are afraid\nlhat if these facts become generally known,\ntheir religious denominations will sink In\npublic estimation, and lhat they themselves\nwill be shorn of much of their respectability\nand influence. They also perceive that ths\nAnti-Slavery lecturers are wishful to lay the)\nburden and the task of rebuking the Amen\ncan churches upon them, and upon their cAur\n7ie. They perceive lhat the anti-slavery\nlecturers consider it to be the duty of the\nchurches and ministers of Great Britain, to\ndisclaim all Christian fellowship with thn\nAmerican churches, until they have purged\nthemselves from the guilt nnd abominations\nof slavery. They perceive lhat if the princi-\nfiles of the anti-slavery lecturers are general\ny received, l hoy , the ministers will be called\nupon at once to require, that the American\nchurches shall cilhor separate themselves\nfrom slavery, or that they shall be called up\non to separate themselves from the American\nchurches. For a Btcp like this the ministers\nof Leeds are not prepared. Many of the\nministers of this country are on friendly terms\nwith the slave-holding and slavery-advocating\nministers of America. Many of our\nEnnliBh Doctors of Divinity have received\ntheir honours from American theological in\nstitutions. In some cases the churches of\nthis country have received liberal pecuniary\nsupport from the churches of America; and\neven lately, the Free (1) Church of Scotland\nreceived no less than three thousand pounds\nfrom the slave-holding churches of America\nthemselves, towards the erection of churches\nand the support of their ministers. 1 o sepa\nrate, therefore, at once from the American\nslave-holding churches, would require a sac\nrifice both ot enfres and of feeling on the\npari of Ihe ministers and churches ot this\ncountry; and for such sacrifices, the minis\nters of this country sre not prepared.\nllecnuse, it is douhtrul whether the Amer\nican Anii-slavery cause will become popular\nin this country. It is doubtful whether the\nwealth and respectability, the greatness and\nthe nobilily of this country, will take part in\nthe abolition movement. It is doubtful\nwhether the ministers of this country will bo\nnble to increase lliofr usefulness, to add to\ntheir popularity and influence amongst the\nperple, by taking part with the friends of the\nslave. The aboliiionists are stein, uncom\npromising men. They appear to prefer the\nprinciples they advocate, and the interests of\nthe cause in which they are engaged, to sve-'\nry oilier consideration. They do nol attempt\nto conciliate Ihe prejudices of men. They pay\nno regard to the feelings of those who stand\nin their way. They epeak right out. They\nutter their convictions, and their strong, ir\ndignant feelings, in language the most un\nguarded. Their rebukes of wrong and cruel\nty are terribly severe. They neglect the usu\nal rules of prudence, and though men of migh\nty, of extraordinary abilities, they are lack\ning in tact and policy. And these qualities\nexpose them lo much reproach and opposi\ntion. The world is too bad to be reformed\nal once. It is too corrupt to bear the trulli\nwithout a veil. It cannot bear the uncom\npromising virtue of thoso unsparing reform\ners, it requires to be uean wun gciaiy, ji\nrequires to have tho truth presented lo it by\ndegrees. It requires to be brought over to tht\ncause of freedom imperceptibly. These, the\nprinciples ol policy, ol expediency, are Ihe\nprinciples on which the ministers of this\ncountry think It needlul to proceed. IJut\nthese principles are cast aside as worthless,\nas un-chrislian, as wicked, by the anil-slave\nry lecturers. They go straight on. I hey\ncare for nothing but the true, the right, the\ngood. So far from being alraid to irritate the\nevil-doers, they even seem to rejoice in Ihe\nprospect of irritating and rousing them. So\nfar from being atraid ot snocKing me prejudi\nces of slave-holders, and of slavery-uphold\ning ministers and churches, they appear to\nthink they cannot shock such guilty ones loo\nmuch, or shock them too soon. With the\nspirit of such men, the orthodox ministers of\nLeeds, and the orthodox ministers of this\ncounlry generally cannot sympathize. To\nthe principles and proceedings of such men,\nlliey are unablo to give their sanction. They\nconsider that the interests of the church mint\nbe first secured, and the interests of humani\nty next, that the cliara.-lcrs of the ministers\nof religion must bo hold sacred, whether sla\nvery he abolished or not, lhat the unity of\nthe church must be promoted if possible,\nwhether the slave can be emancipated or nol.\nAnd it is on this account in the first place,\nthat the ministers of Leeds absented them\nselves from the anti-slavery meetings, end\nrefused to take pnrt in the anti-slavery move\nment of the League,\nAgain ; the ministers of Leeds had anoth\ner reason for absenting themselves from those\nmcetinire. The advocates of abolitionism\nhave given no proof of the orthodoxy of their\nopinions. Neither Garrison, nor Douglass,\nnor Wright have given any satisfactory proof\nto the Christians and ministers of this coon-\ntry, that they hold the great doctrines or the\ngospel as held by the various orthodos de\nnominations, and as embodied in the ortho\ndox creeds of this land. They have given\nno proof that they believe in the doctrine of\nIhe natural, hereditary and total depravity of\nthe human heart in consequence of the one\ntransgression of Adam. They have given no\nsatisfactory proof that they hold the doctrine\nuluve-liolilimr MetboilinU of America in hi Ser\nmons, lie Biiawen.

As far\nas practicable, I would have none others for its\nofficers. Hat, whilst the territory is the nation's,\nall its officers should ba acknowledged to he officers\nand servanM of the nation.\nI proceed to say, that I am op{K>sed to this bill,\nin the fourth place, because it looks to the existence\nof slavery iu these territories, and provides\nsafeguards for it. la other words, Congress does,\nby the terms of the hill, open the door for slavery\nto enter those territories. Tho right of Congress\nto <lo so I deny. I deny it, however, not becauae i\nthe compromise of 1820 denies it. Believing i\nthat compromise to be invalid, 1 cannot honeetiy i\nlaim anything under it. 1 disclaim ail rights i\nunder it, for tlio simple rowon. that a com pro- c\nmisc conceived in sin And brought forth in ini- I\nrjuity, can impart no rights ? for the simple rea- i\nton, that a compromise, which annihiiatos rights, I\nranuot create rights. I admit, that the coinpro- a\nmise of 1820 concede* the indestructibletiess of\nmanhood north of the line of 38? 30', excepting I\nin Missouri. But, on the other hand, it atonos t\nfor this concession to truth and justice by impli- t\nodly leaviug men south of that line, and in ?\nMissouri, to be classed with brutes and things. 1 v\ni.iinit, too, that they, wlio are enjoying the share c\nr?f slavery uuder this compromise, and who, now, s\nLhat freedom was about to enter into the enjoy- ?\nment of her share under it?I admit, 1 say, that c\nthey are estopped from joining ine in pronouncing t\nthe Missouri compromise invalid. They must e\nfirst surrender their share under the oompro- f\nmise ? they must first make restitution to Free- t\nlom ? ere they can, with clears hands and un- c\nblushing faces, ask her to forego the enjoyment S\n!>f her share. \" But this condition is imprartica- t\nIde!\" will some of my hearers say. Oh no! v\nnothing is impracticable, that is right. Exclude s\ndavery from Missouri and Arkansas for thirty- v\nFour years; and then freedom and slavery will I\nbe on an equal footing, aiul they can make a now\nbargain. I Laughter.] e\nNor do 1 deny the right of Congress to open (\nthe door for slavery into these territories, because J\nthe compromise of 1850 virtually denies it. I i\nsay that compromise virtually deniee it, because r\nit distinctly and approvingly recognises the com- r\npromise of 1820. The compromise of 1850 is as r\nrotten as the compromise of 1820; and as inca- i\npahle of imparting right*. And here let mo say, 1\nthat 1 rejoice to see tho pro-slavery party pour- s\ning express contempt on the compromise of 1820, 1\nand virtual contempt on tho compromise of 1850. t\nAnd why should uot all tnon pmrr contempt upon s\nthese compromises, and upon all other compro- r\nmiscs, which aim \"to split the difference\" be- a\ntween Cod and the dovil ? [Great laughter.]\nBy tho way, we have striking proof, in the instance\nof this bill, that, in the case of such compromises.\nGod's share and art are, in the end, very c\nlike to be claimed for the devil. [Renewed s\nlanghter.] I\n1 U - _ J L-* 1- !t a *L-i 1 4\ni iijivr rnui oil wnui ^runnus ii i* nui, inni i ?\ndeny tho right of Congress to open the door for i\nslavery into these territories. I will now say on J\nwhat ground it is. I deny it on the ground, that t\nthe Constitution, the only law of the territorieg, t\nis not in favor. of slavery, and that slavery can- c\nnot be set up under it. ff there can be lawful c\nslavery in the States, nevertheless there cannot f\nbe in tho territories. f\nIn the fifth and last place. I am opposed to tho ?\nhill, becanso it allows, that there may be slavery t\nin the States, which shall he formed from these s\nterritories. 1\nHitherto, when the slavery question has been 5\nbrought up in Congress, it hss been alleged, (I s\nsav not how truly or nntruly,) that tho anti-sla- I\nvery party has brought it up. and for the purpose J\nof checking slavery. But, now, it is, confessedly 1\non all hands, brought up by the pro-slavorv par- s\nty, and ft>r the purpose of extending slavery. Iu t\nthis instance, the pro-slavery party is. manifestly,\nthe instrument, which truth has wielded to sub- '\nserve her purpose of re-awakening the public '\nmind to the demands and enormities of slavery. '\nMost sincerely do 1 rejoice, that the pro-slavery\nparty is responsible for the present agitation. t\nA M smoke. I do not admit, that it is.\nMr. SMITH. Strange! Here is a movement\nfor the immense extension of slavery. Of course,\nt is not the work of the anti-slavery party. And |\nf the honorable member, who has just interrnptsd\nuio. is authorized to speak for the pro-alalerv\nparty, it is not tho work of that party either. 1\n1 took it for granted, that the pro-slavery party *\nlid it.

The\nterlaration of Independence was the declaration\nif the fact of the American Union: and to that\niaper pre-eminently are we to look for the causes\nnd character and objects of the American Union,\nt was for a present, and not for a prospective,\n\"nion?for a Union already decided on, and not '\n, contingent Union?that our Fathers went\nhrough a seven years war.

The Articles of\nConfederation and the Federal Constitution were\niut expedients for promoting the perpetuity, and\nnultiplying and securing the happy fruits, of this\nfuion. Not only is it not true, that the Articles\nf Confederation and the Federal Constitution\n.re paramount to the Declaration of Independnce,\nbut it is true, that the Congress of the Conederation\nand the Convention, which framed the\n\"onstitution, derived nil their legitimacy and e\nuthoritv from the Declaration of Independence.\n'oh might as well talk of supplanting the Bible p\nrith the farthing Tract written to expound it, a* a\nalk of supplanting the Declaration of Independ- a\nnee with an\/ subsequent paper.

It does so, because it is ne- f,\neesary to preserve these rights. Does this paper *\nlaim the right to alter or abolish the Govern- H\nBent? It claims it, for the sake of this great d\nruth. It claims it, in order to. provide better tl\necuritv for these rights. ^\nI do not forget, that the Declaration of Indc- n\niendenee has fallen into disrepnto among the de- n\n;enorate sons of the men, who adopted it.

Now,\n>ur first question is not what w the character of\nhe Constitution, in respect to slavery.4>ut what,\nrom the circumstances of the case, might wo realonably\nexpect to lind its character, in this reipect.\nIts reasonably expected character may bo\nbought by many to shed light upon ih? actual\n:haractcr. Looking at tho circumstances of tho\n:*sc, are we to expect to find the Constitution\niro-slavery or anti-plaverv ? ? made to uphold\nilavery, or to leave it an unprotected outlaw ?\nIt is argued, that the Constitution must he on\nihe side of slavery. for the reason, that it did not\nipeeific&lly demand the instant death of slavery,\n[\"here is, however, no foreo iu this argument, if we\notlect,that American slavery was, at that time, a\nlying slavery ; and that, therefore, even those of\n>ur statesmen, who were most opposed to it, were\ngenerally willing to leave it to die a natural death,\nather than to force it out of existence. Were a\nnan condemned to he hang?nevertheless, if,\nvhen the day for hanging him had arivod, he\nvere on liis death-bed, you would not hang him,\n>ut you would leave him to die on his bed?to\nlie a natural, instead o? a violent, death. That\nmr fathers did not anticipate the long continumce\nof slavery, is manifest from their purpose\nlisclosed in the Preamble of tho Constitution and\nlecw here, to set up a government, which should\nnaintain justice and liberty. They knew, that\n10 government could prove itself capable of this,\nf under the influence, especially the overshadiwing\ninfluence, of slavery.\nIt is further argued, that the Constitution must\n>e on the side of slavery, beeanse were it not on\nhat side, the slaveholders would not have con;ontod\nto its adoption. But they, who argue thus,\nconfound the slaveholders of that day with the\nlaveholdors of this. They forget, that the slavetolders\nof that day breathed the spirit of the\n)eclaratiun of Independence, and were captivated\n>y the doctrine of the human brotherhood.^ They\n'orget, that the slaveholders of that day were im>atient\nto emancipate their slaves, and that in\nrirginfa, whore the number of slaves was so much\ness than now. they were emancipated, at that\n>eriod, at the rate of a thousand a year. They\norget, that there were Abolition Societiee in\nlave States, both before and after the year\n800. They forget, that Washington and Jefferson\nvere practical emancipationists. They forget,\nhat, whilst the slaveholders of this generation are\nntent on perpetuating and extending slavery, the\nIaveholders of that generation, studied how to\nibolish it. and rejoiced in tho prospect of its speedy\nibolition. They, forget, that, whilst the slaveinlHars\nnf this dav are eaffer to oversnrearl our\nvhole national territory with slavery, all etho\nlaveholders of that day joined with all other\nAmericans in denying it new territory, and cxeluling\nit from ever? foot of the national territory.\nI'hey forget, that all the Mtatcs, at that time, with\nhe exception of South Carolina and Georgia, advocated\nthe anti-slavery policy; and that even\nhese two States could hardly bo said to hare\n>pposed it. And what, more than everything\ndse, they should not forget, is that, over the whole\nength and breadth of the land, slavery was, at that\nlay, a confessed sin?a sin it is. true, that all involved\nin it had not the integrity to put away imnediately?but\na sin, nevertheless, which all of\nhem purposed to put away, in no very distant\nuture. How striking the caatrast, in this respect,\n>etween the circumstances of the slaveholder of\nhat time and the slaveholder of this! Now, the\nlible, both at the North and at the South, is\nlaimed to be for Slavery ; and now the church\nind chnreh-ministrv, at the South, do nearly all\n;o for slavery; and at the North, do nearly all\ntpologir.e for it. Now, slavery is right, and the\nibolition of it wrong. Now, the slaveholder is\nhe saint, and the abolitionist the sinner. To ilustrate,\nin still another way, the absurdity of inerring\nwhat slaveholders desired and did, sixty or\neventy years ago, from what they desire and do\niow :?the pecuniary motive of the slaveholder to\niphold slavery is now very strong. Thon, it was\nery weak. American cane-sugar, now wet with\nhe tears and sweat and blood of tens of thousands\nif slaves, was then scarcely known.

To judge what character they would\n* like to give to the Constitution, in respect to\nlavery, we must take our stand-point amidst the\nnti-siavery scenes and influences of that period,\nnd not amidst the pro-slavery scenes and iiiucnces,\nwhich illustrate and reign orer the\nresent.\nI readily admit, that the slaveholders of the\nresent day would not consent to the making of\nny other than a pro-slavery Constitution. I\nen admit, that, had the making of the Oonstiution\nbeen delayed no more than a dozen years,\n; would, (eonld it then have been made at all,)\nave been pro-slavery. I make this admission,\necause I remember, that, during those dozen\nears, Whitney's cotton gin. (but for which inTenon\nAmerican slavery would, long ago, hare disppeared,)\ncame into operation, and fastened slaery\nupon our country.\nIn tho light of what I have said, how improliale\nit is, that the slaveholders were intent on havkg'the\nConstitution made to uphold slavery,\nnt, in the light of what I shall now say, how\nnprobahle it is. that such a Constitution was\niade. Mr. Madison was among the most influenal\nmembers of the Convention, that framed the\nonstitntion ; and when he declared, in the Con- 1\nntion, that he \"thought it wrong to admit in the\nConstitution the idea, that there could be prop- 1\nsrty in man,\" not one person objected to the dec- 1\nration'.

Rut only four days before the Convention of\nclosed its labors, tho word \" servitude H was struck su>\nout of tlio Constitution, and tho word \"service\"' iui\nunanimously adopted in its place, for the avowed els\nreason, that the former expresses the condition tin\nof slaves, and the latter the obligations of free rej\npersons. 1 add tho incidental remark, that if the po\nConstitution is responsible for slavery, it is so, bl?\nbe cause of the knavery, or ignorance, of its fra- I be\nmors. If ou tho one hand, notwithstanding their ad\navowed reaaon for the substitution of \"ecrvioe\" po\nfor \" servitude,'* tlioy still intended to have the in\nConstitution thus responsible, then they wero vii\nknaves:?and if. on the other, they honestly in- is\ntended to keep tho Constitution clear of this guilty th<\nresponsibility, and yet failed to do ao, then does in*\nsuch failure betray their gross ignorance?tlioir lot\ngross ignorance of th4 Hue meaning, and fit use, sla\nof words. Happily, for thoee. who giro an anti- isl:\nslavery construction to the Constitution, they are set\nunder no necessity and no temptation to inter- do\npret tho motives and condnct of its frainers in\nthe light of so odious an alternative. The pro- wl\nslavery party alone are compelled so to interpret an\ntheui. Now, eveu were it true, that the frauiers er<\nof the Constitution, and all of them, too, sought ?ti\nto smuggle slarery into it?to get it into it, with- on\nout its being seen to be got into it?nevertheless, a i\nhow could they accomplish tins object, which, by is 1\nthe restrictions they had im]>oaod on themselves, tio\nthey had rendered^ impracticable?

A sad ^\nmistake, as it turns out, was this suffering of '\nslavery to drag out its death-struck and feeble \"\nexistence through that generation, in which the 1\nConstitution was adopted !?for, it was in that r'a\nvery generation, that, in consequence of the in- to '\nvention already spoken of, slavery became strong, an<\nand began to demand prolonged life and vast\npowers as a right?an absolute snd permanent to I\nright. The slut, in La Fontaine's fable, on the or\neve of becoming a mother, implored, the brief to\nloan of a kennel.

This, at least, is anti-slavery : and this lan\ntells n* that the Constitution is anti-slavery? not\nfor it tells us, that one thing, for which the Con- the\nstltution was made, was \" to secure the blessings the\nof liberty\"?not to inflict, or sustain, the curse of unl\nslavery ^but \"to socure the blessings of liberty.\" tioi\nI admit^ that the Preamble is not the Constitn- pro\ntion. ' admit, that it is but the porch of the tno\ntemple- Nevertheless, if, instead of the Pemon noi\nor Ma'wj coiiea up in tnat porrn, we see ine or\nGoddess of Liberty standing proudly there, then spe\nwe mey infer, that the temple itself, instead of the\nbeing polluted with Slavery, is consecrated to \"tit\nLiberty. And we are not mistaken in this in- foo\nference. As we walk through the temple, we Am\nfind, that it corresponds with the entrance. The thu\nConstitution is in harmony with the Preamble.\nThe first reference, in the Constitution, to sla- ft'g\nvery, is in the apportionment clause. There is, \"iti\nhowever, no reference to it here, if the language are\nis interpreted, according to its legal sense, or if eve\nthe framers of the Constitution were intelligent Res\nand honest. It must be remarked, that it was i\"c<\nfrom this clause, that they struck out the word wh;\n\" servitude,\" for the avowed purpose of saving it the\nfrom being a pro-slavery clause. But, in point Rut\nof fact, if this clause does refer to slavery, it is,\nnevertheless, a clause not to encourage, but to coa\ndiscourage, slavery. The clause diminishes the\npower of a State in the national councils in pro- to t\nportion to the extent of its slavery. This clause itj 1\nis, in truth, a bounty on emancipation. Had it tree\nprovided, that drnnkards should each count but hig'\nthree-fifths of a man, it, surely, weuld not be of t\ncalled a clause to encourage drunkenness. Or,\nhad it provided, tb&t they, who can neither read sift'\nnor write, should each eount but three-fifths of Sou\na man, it, surely, would not be called a clause rl*r\nto encourage illiteratenese. In the one case, it mor\nwould be a bounty on sobriety, andkin the other, drcr\non education. all 1\nThe next clause of the Constitution, which we T?7\nwill examine, is that, which, confessedly, empow- the i\nsrs Congress to abolish the foreign slave-trade. *hal\nI, of course, mean the clause, which empowers shot\nCongress to regulate commerce with foreign na- l?te<\n(ions. Yee, the slave States confessedly conceded\nto Congress tbe power to abolish that trade j ing <\n\\ ER\nIS PON DING EDITOR.\n- -??\nd CongreM did actually abolish it. But, it is t>\nd, that the provision, respecting 44 migration t\nimportation,\" suspended the exerciso of this i\nwer for twenty years. Under no legal and s\n>per souse of it, however, does this provision c\ner to slaves. But, for the sake of the argument, 4\n> will admit, that it does, and that it had the 1\nset to suspend, for twenty years, the exercise 4\nthe power in question. What then? The t\nipenaiou could not destroy, nor, to any degree, t\npair, ths essential anti-slavery character of the r\nmis under consideration. On the contrary, o\n? suspension itself shows, that the clause was n\njarded, by the makers of the Constitution, as t\ntentially anti-slavery?as one, that was capa- c\nt of being wielded, and that, probably, would <j\nwielded, to suppress the slave-trade. 1 would\nd, that this briof suspension goes to justify the t\nsition, that American slavery was looked upon, a\nthat day, as a rapidly expiring practice?as a ii\n:e, that would dio out, in a few yoars. Thore I\nmuch historical evidence, that the abolition of f\ns slave-trade was looked to by many, if not, p\nloed, by most, at that time, either ns equiva- v\nit to, or as sure to result in, the abolition of I\nivcry. The power given to Congress to ahol- t]\nt the slave-trade, Mr. Daww, in the Massachu- c\nts Convention, that a<lopted the Constitution, t\ndared to be 14 the mortal wound\" of slavery. i\nManifestly, the clause of the Coue'ilution. c\nicfa imparts power to abolish the slave-trade* 'J\nd not that, which briefly suspends the eies- \\\nise of this powor, gives character to the Con- t\ntutiou. If my neighbor deeds mo his farm, l\nly reserving to himself the possession of it for t\nnonth. (and a week in the life of an individual c\nlonger than twenty years in the life of a us- i\nn,) it would, certainly, be very absurd to call i\ni transaction for continuing him in the owner- c\nP and possession of tho farm. Or, if the bar- t\nin, which 1 make with my neighbor, is, that, s\nor a week's delay, he shall come into my ser- I\n? for life, it is certainly not this little delay,\nit is to stamp the essential and important t\naracter of the bargain. ii\nI have reforred to only a part of the clause, e\nlicit gives power to Congress to abolish tho h\nve-trade; to only that part, which respects (\ns foreign slave-trade. I, now. add, that this c\n,ll?0 cives ermal nnwer to abolish the inter- r\nlie glare-trade. And if it doc?, how idle must i(\nhe to iay, that a Conititution, which empower* u\nngress to abolish, not only the foreign, hut tho -J\nmestic glare-trade, is a Constitution for alary!\nTo abolish the domestic slave-trade is to C\nt the very jugular of slavery. p\nBut it is said, that the power \" to regulate com- a\n>rce among the several States \" ia not a power ]\nabolish the slave-trade between them. But, t\nit is not, then the power \" to regulate com- p\niree with foreign nations \" is not a power to t\noliah the African slave-trade. Nevertheless, t\nngress held, that it was; and, in that day,\nlen slavery was*not in tho ascendant, every- c\ndy agreed with Congress.\nIt is further said, that the Constitution knows c\nman beings only as persona; and that, hence, c\n> inter-State traffic in slaves, being, in its eye, d\nt migration or travel, Congress has 110 power 0\nsuppress it. Then, what right had Congress t\nabolish the African slave-trade ? The subjects v\nthat traffic, no less than the subjects of the a\ncr-Htate traffic, are persons. Another reply, c\nlich we make to the position, that all human t\nings are persons in tho eye of tho Constitution, n\nthat it cannot lie in the mouth of those, who r\ntj on the traffic in slaves, to ignore the true h\niraeter of that traffic, and to shelter its chat- n\n-subjects under the name of persons. And F\nother reply, which wo make to this position is, ii\nit it is true; and that, hence, the traffic, in b\nves, every slave being a person, is uneonstitu- v\nnal. If the Constitution grants power to Con- fi\n>ss over commerce, it necessarily defines the v\nojects of the commerce. Such definition is s\nolved in such grant. But slaves cannot come f\nthin such definition?for pIktcs are persons, s\nrl persons cannot be the subjects of commerce. 4\nd still another reply, that we have to make to 4\n>se, who would exempt the inter-State traffic 4\nhuman beings from the control of Congress. '\nthe ground, that Congress can know no human 4\ning as a chattel, or n4 other than * person, is 4\nit they are driven by logical consistency and 4\npeal necessity to the conclusion, that the Con- 4\nlotion has power to sweep away the whole of 4\nsei ican slavery. The Constitution extends its 4\neld over every person in the United States; 4\nd every person in the United States has rights 4\nicified in tli? Constitution, that are entirely '\nompatible with hit subjection to slavery. 4\nEre leaving this topic, F would notice an objec- 4\nn, which is frequently heard from the lips of 4\nnest anti-slavery men. It is, that the Consti- 4\nion omits to command Congress, in terms, to 4\nrdish the African slave-trade, even at the end 4\nthe twenty years. But why do they fail to see, 4\nit. this very omission marks the anti-slavery 4\ntrader of the Constitution and of the day. 4\nen it was written? Doomed slavery then\nided an express stipulation for its respite. Hut 1*\nenjoin anti-slavery action upon those, who\njld be held back from it only by such express c\n[?ulation, was, of course, deemed superfluous. 1<\n? sentence of the court is, that the mother shall tl\nt kiss her infant for twenty days. The court d\n?d not enjoin, that she shall kiss it, after the !\nonly days are expired. Her love for her infant o\nkes such injunction quite superfluous. So\ns it unnecessary to enjoin upon the anti-sla- \/<\ny zeal of our fathers the abolition of the slavedc,\nat the expiration of tho twenty years. t<\nircelv had the twenty years expired, before o\nit zeal forbade, under tho heaviest penalties, u\ni continuance of that accursed trade. An an- ii\nnt nation regarded parricide as too unnatural tl\n1 monstrous a crime to need tho interdiction s\nlaw. And our fathers regarded the African t<\nvc-trade as a crime so unnatural and inon- h\nnus, as to make their injunctions on Congress o\nabolish it altogether superfluous. o\nA'e have, now. disposed of two of the three\nuses of the Constitution, which are assumed 11\nHe pro-slavery, viz : the apportionment clause,\n1 the migration and importation clause. The n\nrd refers to fugitive servants, but certainly not\niigitive slaves. Whether we look at tho letter c'\nhistory of this clause, it can have no reference w\nslaves. No one pretends, that slaves are ''\niressly and clearly defined in it; and, hence, c\nording to the rule of the Supremo Court, 11\nich I have quoted, slaves arc not referred to n\nit. Again, none deny, that the terms of the n\nuse make it applicable to apprentices, minor 'f\nIdrrn, and others. All admit, that, in the ^\nst natural use of language, it is capable of\nocent applications. 9l\n1'he clause, under consideration, speaks of a\nsrson held to service or .labor in one State,\nier the laws thereof.'' Now, unless thpse\ns are for slavery, the 44 service or labor\" can;\nbe slavery:?and if they nre for slavery, then\ny cannot hold any person to slavery, unless \"\nV are valid laws. Hut they are not valid laws, j\nless they are in harmony with the ConstHu- .\na. If the Constitution is against slavery, then ''\ni-slaverv laws are but nominal laws. It will be \"\nre timely, At the rlose of my argument than\nr, to say, whether the Constitution is against, ^\nfor, slavery. In the next place, the clause\naks of a person. Hut, as we shall more fully see, et\nre are rights claimed for persons by the Con- ni\nution itael\/, which must all be trodden under th\nt. before person* can be reduced to slavery. T\nother reason, why the fugitives referred to in c<\n? clause are not slaves, is. that ' service or a?\nor\" is \"due\" to their employer from these of\nitivcs. But slaves, by every American dofi- b<\non of slaves, are as incapable of owing, as v<\nhorses, or even horse-hlocks. Bo too, by si\nry English definition of slaves. Says Justice m\nt, in case of Forbes xs. Corhran: \"A slave is at\nspable of compact.\" And another reason, sc\nr this clause cannot refer to slaves i* that sc\nfugitives in it are held by the laws to labor, ot\nslaves, no more than oxen, are held by the si'\ns to labor. The laws no more interpose to ai\nipel labor in the one case than in the other, br\n1 stili another reason, why this clause is not di\n>e taken as referring to slaves, is the absurd- co\nof supposing, that our fathers consented to ru\n,t as slaves whatever persons, white or black, In\ni or low, virtuous or vicious, any future laws w<\ninv State might declare to be slaves. Shall nn\nof the North be bound to acquiesce in the wt\nery of our children, who tnay emigrate to the is\nth, provided the laws of the South shall de- air\ne Northern emigrants to be slaves? Nay, cri\ne, shall we be bound to replnnge those rhil- of\ni into slavery, if they escape from it? Bnt m*\nbis we shall be bound to do, if the pro-sla- Ku\n' interpretation of the clause in question is thi\ntrue interpretation. Ay, and in that case, we fee,\n1 be bound to justify even our own slaver)-, cla\nild we be eaught at the Sonth. and legis- wo\n1 into slavery.

I\nant and unauthorized. The Supremo Court of m\nho United State* opened a wide door to this eud, at\nu the case of Strader and others against (iorfuun, ot\nouie throe years ugo. In that case, the court hi\nlainied, tliat a State \" has an undoubted right to\ndetermine tho statu*, or domeetic and social con- si\nditlon, of the persons domiciled within its terri- lii\ntor;r.\" Hy tho way. this doctrine of the Supreme\n'ourt, that there are no natural rights; and cr\nhat all rights stand but in the concessions and w\nincertainties of human legislation, is a legitimate M\nntgrowth of slavery. For slavervtis a war upon m\nlaluro, and is thu devourer of thu rights of na- in\nure ; and claims, that all rights, and all inter- A\nsts, natural and conventional, shall acoommo- it\niate themselves to its demands. in\nWe uood spend no more time on tho letter of In\nhis clause. W? will, now. look at its history. It is w\n. well-nigh universal impression, that this clause tli\n? one of the compromises of the Constitution, sli\nSilt there is not the slightest foundation iu truth\nor this impression. In none of the numerous in\nilnns of a Constitution, submitted to its framurs. si\nr.is the subjoct-matlor of this clans? moiitionnd. vi\nndeed, it was not mentioned at all, until twenty si\nlavs before the close of the Convention. This\ndause. wlarn its iuscrtion was first moved, con- st\naincd the Word \"slave.\" But, with that word in tli\nt, it met with such strenuous opposition, as to ei\nompel the immediate withdrawal of the motion, tit\nI'lie next day, however, it was offered again, but\nvith the word \" slave'' struck out. Iu this or\nimeuded and harmless form, it was adopted inilUS.\n...? J.V.t. ? _.\n, mvuuui ur.miD, ?uu UlUUimOUSIT. 1 A)\nidd, by tlie waj, tluit no ouo believes, that a cv\nlause providing, in express terms, for tho sur- (v\nnder of the whole Americaii soil to the chasing \"\ntown and enslaving of men. women, and children, fo\nlould over have gained the vote of the Couven- th\nion; or that, if it had, tho Constitution, with la\nuch a disgusting blot upon it, could evor have ai\n>cen adopted. gi\nAnother reason for not claiming this clause to w\nte pro-slavery is, that tho American people did, pi\nii all probability, regard the word \"service\"' as\nspreading the condition of freemen. So, as we o\nlave seen, tho members of tho Constitutional\nConvention, regarded it: and, inasmuch as they '\name together from ull parts of the country, and 4\nepreseutod all classes and sections of the Amer- 4\nran people, is it not a fair infereuco, that they 4\nised language in the sense approved by the\nImerican people?\nWc have, now, examined those parts of the 4 i\nConstitution, which are relied on to give it a '\niro-slavery character; and wo find, that they ' I\n,re not entitled to give it this character. Wo 4 |\niroceod to (fiance at some, and at only some, of\nhose parts of tho Constitution, which clearly bt\nrove its anti-slavery character; which are ut- 41\nerly incompatible with slavery; and which, 4 l\nherofore, demand its abolition. 4 1\n1st. \"Congress kits power to provide for Ike common\nWrnce and general welfare of the I'nitsd States.\" si;\nBut Congress has not this power, if the obsta- ci\nles of slavery may be put in the way of its exer- rij\nise. A man cannot be said to have law for ?r\nIriving his carriage through the streets, if an- u|\nither man has law for blocking its wheels. If Tl\nhe States may establish tho most atrocious ti<\nirrongs within tlicir borders, and thus create an tit\ntmosphere, in which the Federal Government er\nannot \"live ami move ami have its being;\" in\nhen, within those borders, the Federal Govern- th\nsent may be rcdncod to a nullity. The power th\neferred to in this clause Congress will never is\nave faithfully exercised, ao long aa it loaves ti<\nlillions of foes in the bosom of our country. F<\niy enrolling tho slaves in the militia, and yield- te\nig to their Constitutional right 44 to keep and in\near arms*'?which is, in effect, to abolish sla- la\nery?Congress would convert those foes into th\nriends. Tho power in question, Patrick Henry, C<\niho was then the orator of America, held to be te\nuflicient for abolishing slavery. In the Virginia of\n'onvention, which passed upon the Federal Con- er\ntitution, Mr. Henry said: \"May Congress not of\nsay, that every black man must fight ? Hid we te\nnot see a little of this, the last war? We wete of\nnot so hard pushed-as to make emancipation se\ngeneral. But acts of Assembly pa.ssed. that m\nevery slave, who would go to the army, should hi\nbe free. Another thing will contribute to bring in\nthis event about. Slavery is detested. We feel at\nun iniai eiioeis. wo nepiore it with all the pity ti<\nof humanity. Let all theso considerations. at se\ngome future period, press with full fore# on ill# i?\nminds of Congress. They will read that pa- ?i<\nper, (the Constitution,) and see if they have w\npower of manumission. And hare they not, of\nsir? Have they not power to provide for the hi\ngeneral defence and welfare? May they not th\nthink, that they call for the abolition of slavery 1 of\nliny they not pronounce all slaves free??and pc\nwill they not he warranted by thnt power?\nThere is no ambiguous implication or logical it\ndeduction. The paper speaks to (he point. They dc\nhare the pott er in clear and unequivocal trriiis; to\nand trill clearly and certainly exercise it.'' r<\\\nlid. ' Congress has power to impose e capitation Tl\nix.\" m\nManifestly, Congress ran pay no respeet in this at\naso to the distinction of bond and free. It ran fo\njok for the payment of the tax to none other w\nhan the subjects of the tax. But if any of them w\no not own themselves, they cannot owe th# tax. th\n'his clause implies, therefore, the self-ownership *f\nf men, and not their ownership by others. *r\n3d. \"Congress shall hare power to establish a tent- ti<\njrut rule of naturalization.\" ('<\nBut this power, if faithfully exercised, is fatal th\nd slavery.

Whence, however, is this\nferenco justified ? From the fact, it is answered,\nat the Federal power is the subject-matter ot\no Constitution ? is that, of which it treats ?\nthat, which it constitutes.

They would\nt take this for granted, however, did they know,\nit this fust of the adopted am.mlmente was\n? third of the proposed amendment* ; ami that\nrime to he numbered the first, only heransn\n? preceding two were rejected. It is entitled,\ntrefore, to give no lead and no complexion to\n? amendment*, which follow it.

He proposed two scries\not amendments, uut of them affecting Federal,\nand too other Stato powers. llis proposition\nprovided to have them interwoven iu the original\nConstitution. For instance, the negations\nof Federal Power were to be included iu tlx\nuiutb section of the flrwt article; and the negations\nof State power in the tenth section of that\narticle. And, what is more, several of the\namendments, which he proposed to include in\nthis tenth section, are, not only in substance, but\nalmost precisely in letter, identical with amendments,\nwhich bee am # a part of the Constitution.\nIt was in the following words, that Mr. Msoiaos\njustified his proposition to restraiu the Btatcs :\n\" I think thers is more danger of these powers\n' being abused by the Stale (roveromenta than\n4 by Lhe (jloveniuieut of the Cnited States.'' \" It\n' must be admitted on all hands, that the State\n* Governments are as liable to attack those inval'\nunable privileges, as the General Government is,\n' ami therefore ought to be as cautiously guarded\nagainst.'* ' I should, therefore, wish to extend\n' this interdiction, and add, that no State shall\n4 violate,'' Ac. if thers w.is any reason to restrain\nthe Government of the I'niled States from\ninfringing upon these essential rights, it was\nequally necessary that they should be secured\nagainst the State Governments. He thought,\nthat if they provided against the one, it was as\nnecessary to provide against the other, and was 1\nsatisfied, that it would be equally grateful to the\npeople.\nThe House of Representative# did not adopt\nklr. ilxnisos a plan of distributing the amendments\nthrough the original Constitution, and\nfltllii uYlirracIv dto.lwinfr mi* Li llkA PAilftrAl <4rnl\nanother to a Stale Government.

What, '\nhowever, is still more memorable is, that there .\nwas a vote taken, which shows, that the House\ndid not mean to hare all the amendments applr\nto the General Government only. The vote was\n!ou the following proposed amendment: \"No per'\nsou shall lie snhject, in raae of impeaehmeut. to\n' more than one trial, or one punishment for tho\n' same offetire, nor shall t?e compelled to he a\n' witness against himself, nor be deprived of life.\n' lit>erty, or projasrty, withont duo process of\nfaw,\" Ac.

Is it said, that this conclu- J\nFiou. notwithstanding the manifest logical necessity\nfor arriving at it. is, nevertheless, not sound*\nt>ue of the objection* to its soundness?via : that i\nibe slaveholders could never have consented to J\nadopt a Constitution of such anti-slavery pow- j\n. ore? 1 have already replied to, by saying, that j\nthe slaveholders of that day. being against the |\ncontinuance of slavery, and the slaveholders of i\n1 his day for it. the former cannot be judged of in j\nthe ligbt of the character of the latter. To this i\nI add. that wiiatevei were the slaveholders of\nthat day, and whatever wore their motives in\nwdopliug an anti-slavery Constitution, they, :\nnevorthides, did adopt it, just as it is?-anti- j\nslat cry as it is. The other principal objectiou to J\nthe soundness of tny Conclusion is, that neither ;\nslaveholders nor non-slaveholders would have\nconsented to adopt a Constitution, which annihilates\nMate sovereignty. My answer to the latter\nobjection is, that the States are not sovereign, I\nI and wete not intruded by the Constitution to be\nsovereign. The simple truth is, that our fathers\nrefused to repeat the experiment of a Confederacy\nof Stat*# ; and that, instead of it, they devised\nfor themselves and their Dostrritv a (>nr- t\neminent, which is. altogether, too broad and '\nibiuditig to consist wiih Stale 8<aeroigutj. The\nt'onstitution prescribes limits lo the State quite ,\ntoo narrow for the |dar of sovereignly. It doilies\nthe State many specific powers, each of\nwhich 18 vital to sovereignty. For instance, It [\nrestrains it froin entering into a treaty; nnj from i\n1 ruining money; au<l, if the power to deprive\n\" of life, liberty, or property,\" is vital to sure- i\nrelgnty. then, aa we hare sern, the State is not\nsovereign. because it liaa not this power.

Bonham't Com in hoi\nLift of Lord Bat<m.~\\ mo\nI would add, in tlm connexion, that the pror- |n\nlnce of a human legislature does uot extend even 13 1\nto all lawful and innocent things. That it is com- P*\nmensurate with the whole field of human inter- *?,\noiii and obligations, is a verr great, though a xr?!\nvery common mistake. It covers lint a small <^'1\nportion of that field. Not only are crimes inca- tapable\nof being legalised, but there are number- e<t\nless relations and duties, which are ever to be no\nheld saeied from tho invasion and control of the\nhuman legislature. For instance, what we shall s'l:\ncat ami Wear is a subject foreign to buman legis- n,(\nlation. What shall bo the character of the in- t'li\nterrourso between parent and child is no loss so. *n\nBut if there is a natural, lawful, and innocent re- re<\nlatiou, for which the human legislature may not an\nprescribe, how much less is it authorized to ere- m'\nate the unnatural, monstrous, and supremely *1J\nguilty relations of slavery ! 01\nad. Law is not an absurdity. Lilt is one with\nreason. Hence, in point of fact, a legislature\ncannot make law. Ij can declare what is law.\nIt can legislate in behalf of that only, which is\nalready law. Legislation for liberty may las rft\nlaw, because liberty itself is law. But legis- ,'1'\nlatiou fur *luvery cannot possibly be law, berauke\nslavery is not\/law. That cannot be law, ftH\ntho subject matter of which fs not law. The RM\ngreat fundamental and controlling law in the '*\ncase of a man is. that he is a man. Tho great\nfundamental and controlling law in the case of a m>\nhorse is. that lie is a horse. The great, fundamental\nand controlling law in the cose of a stone Tf\nis. that it is a stone. All legislation, therefore, to\nwhich proceeds ou the assumption. that a stone Te\nis wood,-is absurd and void. So. too, all legis- Pr\nlation, that proceeds on the assumption, that a m)\nhorse is a hog, is absurd and void. Aud. so too, n,<\nand far more emphatically, all legislation, which 18\nproceeds on the assumption, that a man is a\nthing?an immortal (Sod-like being a commodi- ho\nty?it absurd and void.

It\ni right for me to do so. .Such conversion is\nsole essence of slavery. This, and this alone,\niuguishos it from overy other servitude. In !\nit of fact, slavery is not necessarily, and, 1\ni*ad, is not at all, by any just definition of the 1\nd, servitude. I,et the lift of the slave he all\nnoes; and let him he \" clothed in purple and |\nlinen, and fare sumptuously every day;\" and\n,? still as absolutely a slave, as if he wore in 1\nhardest lot of a slave.

Hitch denial is perfectly consul.\nA chattel is untitled to no right#?can\ns no rights. What 1 arraign slavery for, is\nits making a man a chattel. I do not 1\ntign slavery for the terrible enactments,\nch, for its security, it puts into the statutak;\nnor for the teirihle advertisements whioh i\nits into the newspapers. These enactments\nthe Datural and ueceesarv outgrowth of\nblasphemous assumption, that man, with\nLis gi?at attributes and destiny, is capa- <\nof being reduced to a thing.

Slavery itself?not its fruiu i\nincidents?is the wonder. That man should\nfound so perverted and depraved, ap to sink 1\nequal brother info slavery?it is this, and\ntiing incidental to it, or rosulting from it, that\nuld fill us with astonishment, lu reducing a i\ni to a l!iir>g, we have not only committed the\nliept crime agaiust him, tint wo have commitall\ncrimes against hitu ; for we have thrown\nn the door?the door never again to he ghat?\nhe commission of all orimes against hint,\n'crimps, such language, ns I have just beeu\nig, will occusiou the remark, that 1 am prejutd\nagainst the South. Hut I know, that 1 am\n1 love the South equally well with the\ntli. My heart goes out as stromrlv to Hou'th- I\n. as to Northern men, on this floor. Far am I i\nn attributing to Southern men a peculiarly\nere natnre. I had rather attribute to them a\nuliarlj geuerous uaturo. I believo, that there\nuot another people on the earth, in whose i\nids the system of slavery would work more\ndlj?with lees of cruelty and horror. No- i\nsre ran it work well?for there is nothing in it |\nwork well. Nowhere ran it be unattended\nh the most frightful and deplorable abuses?\nit is itself the most stupendous abuse,\nd. My argument, in the third and last place,\nprove, that rnnn? tax bs so law, aiTnta for\nbhicak, or ast othur hlavhrt, is that, that is\nlaw, and is never, never, to he acknowledged\nlaw, which men cannot regard as law, and\nas luw, without beifig dishonest, both heaven\nI earth forbid that, which cannot be, but at\nexpense of integrity. Now, in the conscience\nuniversal man, slavery cannot be law?cannot\ninvested with the claims ami saoreduess of\n-. Hence, to regard it as law, and use it as\nr, is to be dishonest. There may be little,\nno, consciousness of the dishonesty. Noverless,\nthe dishonesty is there. I said, that the\nisciousness, that slavery cannot be legalized,\nuniversal. Let ma not be misunderstood in\nat 1 said. I did not mean, that there are none,\n0 believe, that the slavery of others can be\nalized. I admit, that thousands believe it.\nthe same time, however, 1 affirm, that not one\nthem all would believe slavery to be a thing\nlaw, and entitled to the respect of law, were\n>rouglit to war against himself. The presence\nan enactment for slavery would inspire with\nsense of the sacred obligations of law -with\nsense of the honor and obedience due to law?\nn, who should be claimed under it. Now, how\nh a person is to be regarded?whether as\niering the laws for slavery to bo valid or void,\n1 and true laws, or nominal and no laws -is to\ndecided, not according to his view of them,\nen applied to others, but according to his\nise of them, when brought home to himself.\nIf-application is the testfng crucible in all such\nics.\nIf an Aniorican gentleman is so unfortunate, as\nbe brought under the yoke of slavery in one\nthe I'.arbary States; aud if, notwithstanding,\n> slavery is decreed by the supreme power of\nI Htate. he breaks away from it, and thus pours\ntempt upon the decree aud tha source of it;\nin, obviously, on his return to America, he cant\nacknowledge slavery to-be law, and yee be\nursi. ii 11 is true, uiai ttii.ii is Jaw we. are no\nre at liberty to break in a foreign country than\nour own country, no also is it trim, that what\ntoo abominable and wicked t<> be law in one\nrt of the world is too abominable and wicked\nbe law in any other part of the world. Should\ns gentleman he elected to Congress, he will be\nihonest, if he legislates for slarery. Should he\nle his seat upon the bench, he will be dishon..\nif he administers a statute for slaTery. And\nless dishonest will he he, if, as a juror, or mnrnl,\nor as President of the United States, he\nall contribute to the enforcement of such slntt.\nBut erery American gen tic man would, like\ns one, break away from slaverj if he could ;\na, hence, erery American gentleman, who\nognises slavery a* law, ilon therein stigmatize\n<1 condemn himself. Possibly, however, there\nkj he 3omc American gentleman, who is inirod\nwith such a sense of the fitness and beauty\nslavery, as to welcome its chains about his\nru person. If there is such a one, \" let him\neak?for him have I^oft'ended.\"\nThat no one can honestly recognize a law for\nivery, is on the SHine principle, that no one\nii honestly reooguize a law for murder. But\npre are innumerable things, which all men hold\nnnot be legalized. I venture the remark, that,\nlong all the Judges of this land, who, ever and\non, ere dooming their fellow-men to the pit of\nivery, there is not one. who could he honest in\nministering even a sumptuary law?for there is\nt one of them, who, in his own person, would\ncy such a law. How gross is their hypocrisy!\ntoy affoct to believe, that Government has power\nlegalize slavery?to turn men into things:?and\nt deny, that Government may go so far. as to\nescribe what men shall wear 1 Government\nxj do what it will with the bodies and souls of\n>n :?but to msddle with their clothes?oh, that\nunendurable usurpation 1!!\nIf. then, I am right in'saying, that men cannot\nneatly rocoguize legislation for slavery.as law:\nnnot do so, without palpably violating that great\nw of honesty, which requires us to do unto\nhers, as we would have others do unto us : if,\nI am right in declaring, that, in strict truth,\ni\nriONAL ERA, WASE\nthere is not, in all the broad earth, one pro-slavery\nman: but that every man, when called to\nmake his bed in the hell of slavery, betrays, in the\nagonies of his soul and the quaking of his limbs,\nthe fact, that he is a thorough abolitionist:?if, I\nsay, I am right in all this, then does it irresistibly\nfollow, that 1 am also right, in my position, that\nthshb CAS HM NO LAW, BITHUR FOB AmKKICAH, Oil\nasy othsb Slavsby. I am right in this position,\nbecause, that, by no reasonable theory, or definition,\nof law, can that be called law, which is\nincapable of being admiiflktered honestly. The\nfact, that men must necessarily be dishonest In\ncarrying it out, is, of itself, the most eonclusive\nand triumphant argument, that it is not law. To\ntake the opposite ground, and to claim, that to be\nlaw, whioh every man, when properly tested, denies\nis law, is to insult all trne law, and Him, who\nis the source of all true law. I conclude, under\nthis head, with the remark, that, the question,\nwhether slavery is, or is not to be known as law,\nresolves itself into a question of simple honesty.\nI must say a few words to protect what I have\nsaid from the misapprehension, that I counsel\ntrampling on all wrong legislation. I am very\nfar from giving such counsel. No wrong legislation,\nthat is at all endurable, would I resist. And,\nI add, that 1 would be patient with almost overy\ndegree of wrong legislation, provided it is legislation\nin behalf of what is lawful, and of what it is\ncompetent to legislate upon. Imprisonment for\ndebt is wrong legislation?very wrong and very\ncruel legislation. Hut, inasmuch as the relation\nof debtor and creditor comes within the cognizance\nof the legislature, 1 will not treat such legislation\nas void. Tlia legislature has a right end\nin viow. It is to help the creditor get jnsticc.\nIts error consists in selecting wrong means to this\nend; and in putting a wrong remedy into the\nhands of the creditor. I am to treat this action\nof the legislature as a mistake?and a mistake,\nwhich 1 am not to go beyond the limits of persnasron\nto seek to correct. The paying of one's\ndebts is justice?-is law. Enactment* to enforce\nthis justice and this law may, some of them, ha\nimproper?such as compiling payment by tlie\nterrors of imprisonment. But, as they ara enact\nmenta to enforce justice and what la itaeJf law,\n1 must be rorj alow to denounce them, as no\nlaw. So, too. if tny Government declare war\nagainst a nation?I ain not to treat the Government,\nnor the declaration, however unjust it may\nhe, with contempt. 1 mail remember, that Government\nhaa jurisdiction of national controTeesi\nee. and that the redress of national wronga ia\njustice?ia law. Government ma\/ err in ha modes\nof redreea. It maj reeort to the aword, when\nit ahould confine itself to the exertion of moral\ninfluence. The cauae, nevertheless, which it ia\nprosecuting, may le on# of unoiingled justice,\nbiko every good eanee, it maj itaelf ha law; and,\ntherefore, Government would not he chargeable\nwith impertinence and uaurpation for taking it in\nhand. But, how different from all thia ia it, when\nGovernment aete up slavery! In that coae, the\nBtihject matter of lie action ia, moat emphaticallj,\nnot law. In that eeae. most emphatioelly, it haa\ngone bejond ite province. To Government belongs\nthe adjustment of the relations between\ncreditor and debtor; and it ia for Govornineut to\ndispose of UAtional coutroversiee. But, when\nGovernment, undertakes the crime and absnrditj\nut turning tnon into things?of chattellizing, instead\nof protecting, a portion of ita subjects?it\nLb, then, as far out of ita place, aa it can he. To\nBiich an outrage, no submission ia due. It is to\nhe resisted, at everj hazard. To trample upon\ninch lawlessness is to l>o Law-abiding, instead of\nlaw-hreakiug. To rebel against such a Government\nis not to be revolutionary and inohocratir.\nThe Government itself is the revolutionary and\nmobocratic party If the decree shoold go forth\nfrom onr Government, that our Irish population\nbo murdered, the decree would, of course, be\ntrodden under foot. But who denies, that If\nshould be as promptly and indignantly trodden\nunder foot, were ita decree for their enslavement?\nJly argument to show, that tkkub sot otlt is\nko law for Ambrioak bi.atbst, hpt that thbiib\noa* bh so law, bithkr for ailrbioas, or ast\notb br blatunr, is BsoHD. It is in place, however,\nto say, that tho recognition by the American\npeople of alavory &* l?w, is, of itself, sufficient\nto Recount for their low of reverence for law.\nThis re Terence is, necessarily, deetroyed by the\nhabit of confounding shain law with true law?\nby the habit, of accepting, as law, the mere forms\nof law, where justice, truth, reason, anil erery\nelement, which goes to make up the soul of law,\nis lacking. This rererence must soon die out of\n(he heart of the people, who treat, as law, that,\nwhich they know, is not law; who, in the holy\nand commanding nanio of law, buy and sell, or\nsanction tho buying snd selling, of their fellowmen;\nand who, in all their life, lire out the\ndebasing lie, that so monstrous and diabolical a\nthing, as slavery, is entitled to the shelter and\nhonor of law. This rererence is little felt by\nthose, who yield to the at*urdity, that law and\nnature are opposite to each other; and that,\nwhilst, by nature, a man is an immortal, by law\nhe may be hut a thing. It is little felt by those,\nwho regard law as a mere conrentionalisin, which\nmay be one thing in one place, and another in\nanother; one thing at one period, and another at\nanother. They, and they only, hare adequate\nand adoring conceptions of law, who believe, that\nit is ono with nature, and thAt it is the same in\nerery part of the earth, in every period of time,\nand \"eternal in the heavens.\" They, anil they\nonly, have such conceptions, who, instead of regarding\nlaw as synonymous with *11 the onactmente\nof foolish and wicked men, identify it with\nunchangeable and everlasting right.\nHow. for instance, can the American people\nperceive the beauty and preciousness of law,\nwhilst recognising, as law, the fugitive slave\nact T?and whilst stigmatizing, and persecuting\nthe handful of men, who have the integrity and\nthe bravery to resist it? Why should not that\nhandful fly as swift to the rescue of their brother,\nwho ia in peril of being reduced to slavery, as ts>\nthe rescue of their brother, who cries: \"Murder? *\nTen thousand enactments for murder would not\nhinder thcin in the lattei case. Ten thousand\nenactments for slarery should not hinder them,\nin the former. In each case, the rescue would\nbe not by a mob; but from a mob.\nIt has, now, been shown, that the .American\nGovernment has authority, both inside and outside\nof the Constitution?as well in natural and\nuniversal law, as in conventional and national\nlaw?to sweep away tha whole of American slavery.\nWill it avail itself of this authority to do\nthis work? 1 ask not whether Government will\nshow pity to the slave?for 1 look not to Uovennneut\nto be pitiful to the slave, or to any\nother innn. I look to Government for sterner\nqualities than pity. My idea of a trus (Jovernment\nis realised, only in proportion, as the Goeeruinent\nis characterized by wisdom, integrity,\nstrengih.N To bold even the scales of justice\namong all its subjects, and between thein and all\nother men ; and to strike down 1he hand, that\nwould make them uneven?this, and this only,\nis the appropriate work of Government1\nasked, whether the Ameriran Government\nwill abolish slavery. I confess, that my hope,\nthat it will, is not strong. The slave-owners\nhave the control of this nation, and 1 fear, that\nthey will keep it. It is true, that they are a\ncomparative handful in the vast American population\n; and that, numbering only three hundred\nthousand, their calling themselves \" ths South'*\nIs an affectation as absurd and ridicnlous, as it\nwould be for the manufacturers of the North to\nrail themselves \"the North,\" rtr the rumsellers of\nthe North to rail themselves \"th# North.\" It is\ntrue, that their interests are alien, as well from\nthe interests of ths South, as from the interests of\nthe North ; and that slavery is tha deadly foe, as\nwell of the white population of the South, as of\nits black population. Nevertheless, in the present\ncorrupt state or ttie public sentiment, the slaveownert\nare able to-control the aation. They are\nmighty by their oneness. Divided tliey may he\nin everything else?but they are undivided in\ntheir support of slavery. The Slate and the\nChurch are both in their hands. A bastard\ndemocracy, accommodated to the demands of\nslavery, and tolerating the traffic in human flesh,\nis our national democracy : and a bastard Christianity,\nwhich endorses this bastard democracy,\nis the current Christianity of our nation. The\nfatherhood of Cod and the brotherhood of man?\nideas, so prominent in a true democracy and a\ntrue Christianity?are quite foreign to our sham\ndemocracy and onr sham Christianity. American\nreligion is a huge hypocrisy. Whilst to the immeasurable\nsiufulness of that system, which forbids\nmarriage, and the reading of the Bible, and\nwhich markets men as beasts, it is blind as a bat,\nit, nevertheless, draws down its stupid face, and\npronounces the shifting of the foet to music to\nbe a great sin. The different States of Christendom,\naa they advance iu civilisation and the\nknowledge of human rights, are, one after another,\nputting away slavery. liven the Bey of Tunis\nputs away this most foul and guilty thing: and\nsays, that he doee so \" for the glory of mankind,\nand to distinguish them from the brute creation.\"\nBut America, poor slavery-ridden and slaverycursed\nAmerica, retrogrades. Whilst other nations\ngrow in regard for human rights, she grows\nin contempt for them. Whilst other nations rise\niu the sunlight of civili\/jttion, she sinks in the\nnight of barbarism. Iier Congross sets np slavery\nin her very Capital. Ber Congress regvilatos\nand protects the coastwise trad# in slaves. Her\nCongress wages unprovoked and plundering wars\nfor the extension of slavery. Her Congress decrees,\nthat slaveholders shall have the range of\nall America, in which to rednce men, women,\nand children, to slavery. And her President, who\nMills slavery an \"admitted right,\" was shameless.\n[INGTON, D. C., MA1\nenough to say, in hi^ Inaugural, that the Fugitive\nSlave Act, which his predecessor was shameless\nenough to sign, should be \"cheerfully\" enforced.\nIn short, the Federal Government is now, and\nlong has besn, at work, more to uphold slavery\nthan to do anything else, or even ail things else.\nThe great slave-catcher ! the groat watch-dog of\nslavery 1?these are its most fitting names, in its\npreeont employment and degradation. And, yet,\nnotwithstanding all this devotion of the Federal\nGovernment to slavery, and the iron determination\nof the slave-owners, that the power of the\nwhole nation shall be exerted to uphold It; there,\nnevertheless, can be no remonstrance from the\nNorth against slavery, which is not immediately\nfollowed by the truthless and impudent reply,\nthat the North has nothing to do with slavery i\nThat the American people and American Government\nhave fallen to what they are, is not to be\nwondered at. It is but the natural and necessary\nresult of their having fostered and fed, for more\nthan half a century, the monster slavery. Time\nwas, wheu we might have crushed this monster.\nBut, now, it has crushed us. It has corrupted\nus to such an extent, that there is scarcely a\nsound spot left in us, at which to begin to rally\nopposition to it. On no cheaper condition than\nthis can slavery be clung to. If we will he slaveholders?and\nsuch are the Northern as well as the\nSouthern people?for if the dave-ownrr* are at tho\nSouth, the people of the North are, nevertheless,\nluore emphatically, because more efficiently, tho\n?htv?hokkrt, than aro the people of the South?if,\nI sAy, wa will be slaveholders, wo must take the\nevil consequences upon our own understandings\nand hearts, and not bo surprised at thorn. Men\ncannot bind the degrading chain of slavery\naround their brothers without at the same time\nbinding and degrading themseltea with it.\nHow melancholy upon our country, and,\nthrough her, upon the world, has been the influence\nof American slavery ! In the beginning of\nour national existence, we were the moral and\npolitical light-house of the world. The nations,\n* which sat in darkness, saw the great light,\"\nand rejoiced. Nad to say, we were ourselves the\nfirst to dim that light I The principles, which we\nthen enunciated, electrified the nations.

All other\ncauses combined hava not stood so effectually in\nthe waj of the progress of republicanism, as the\nglaring inconsistency of our deeds with our professions.\nIn the house of her friends, Liberty has\nreceived her deepest stabs. All our boasts and\nfalsehoods to the ooutrarj notwithstanding, there\nis no Gorormuout on the face of the earth so\nquick as our owu, to droad, and to oppose, popular\nmovement* iu behalf of liberty and republicanism.\nOu our Governmeut, more than ou all other\ncauses put together, rests the responsibility of\nthe stopping of the Revolution in the Spanish\nAmerican States. We are wont to any, that\ntho people of those States were incompetent to\njterfrct that Revolution. This is a piece of our\nhypocrisy. The instructions of our Government\naud the discussions in our National Legislature,\nin regard to the Congress of Panama; our threat\nof war against Colombia and Mexico, if those\nStates persevered in carrying forward tho Revolution\n; and, above all, our baao supplication to\nRussia and Spain to join us in stopping the wheels\nof that Revolution; prove conclusively, that\nthough our lying lips were for liberty, our hearts,\nall the time, were concerned but for the protection\nof slavery. And, in the case of Hay ti?how deadly,\nfrom first to last, has been tho enmity of our\nGovernment to the oouse of liberty and repubcan\nism !

But who\nIs so stupid, aa to accord sincerity to that display,\nwhen he recollect*, that the very first fruit of the\nvery first of these Revolutions was the unqualified\nabolition of all French slavery?and a part of\nthat slavery in the neighborhood of our own ?\nSo eager was our Government to appear to be on\nthe side of Hungary, thai it sent out a ship for\nKossuth. But, long ore he had reached our\nshores; and, especially, whilst he was making his\nspeeches in Hngland in behalf of the equal rights\nof all men ; our Government found out, that it had\ngot more than it contracted for. Kossuth's priiveiplee\nwero too radical. Their scope was quite\ntoo sweeping. They no more spared slavery thai:\nany other form of oppression. Yet, Government\ncould not stop Kossuth on his way. Having\nstarted for A jo erica, he must be suffered to come\nto America. But how great his disappointment,\non his arrival! \" He came unto his own, and bis\nown received him not.'1 The poor man was willing\nto compromise matters. A thousand pities,\nthat he was. He was willing to ignore slavery,\nand to go through the whole length and breadth\nof the land, seeing, iu every man he mot, nothing\nelse than a glorious freeman. Alas, what a mistake!\nThe policy of the Government \"to give\nhim the oold shoulder\" was fixed; and no concessions\nor humiliations on his part conld suffice\nto repeal it. Kossnth left America?and he left\nit, no less abundantly than painfully convinced,\nthat America is one thing in the Declaration of\nIndependence, and another in what has succeed- (\ned it; one thing in her professions, and another\nin her practice. Will Mav.sini need to come to\nAmorica to learn this lesson? And. if he comes,\nwill he stoop to repeat Kossnth's mistakes f\nThank God ! kfaar.ini has already identified himself\nwith the Americau abolitionists. May he\nfind himself rewarded by their eordial ideutificatiou\nof themselves with the oppressed of Burope !\nI confessed, that my hope is not strong, that\nthe American Government will abolish Americau\nslavery. Far otherwise would it be. however, did\nnone, but slave-owners, Justify slavery. Tliey\nwould soon he converted, were it not, that the\nmass of the American people fall in with them,\nami flatter them, ami cry peace, when there is no\npeace. This is our great discouragement iu the\nease. The advocates of total abstinence are not\ndiscouraged. They would be, however, if they\nfound the mass of the sober justifying drunkards,\nand tolling them, that drunkenness is right.\nI said, at an early stage of my remarks, that the\npresent attempt of slavery to clutch all the unorganised\nterritory of the nation affords a favorable\nopportunity to freedom to push back the war into\nthe realm of slavery. I, however, did not add,\nthat the opportunity would be improved. Xor do\nI add it now ;?for I am far from certain, that it\nwill he. For many years, I have had scarcely\nany better hope for American slavery, than that\nit would come to a violent and miserable eud.\nTheir habit of courting and worshipping the\nslave-power, and of acquiescing in its demands,\nhas corrupted and paralysed the American peotle\nto suoh a degree, as to leave little room to\nope, that they will bring slavery to a peaceful\nand happy termination. I confess, some little\nhope of such termination has heeu kindled in\nme by thia new, surpriaing, and enormous demand\nof the alave-power. 1 confess, that I have\nthought it possible, that this demand might\narouse a spirit, which could he appeased by nothing\nshort of the overthrow of the whole system of\nslavery. Should, however, such a spirit be\naroused, I r?ar it will not pervade the masses, hilt\nwill be confined to a few. It ia true, that meetings\nare held, all over the free States, to protest\nagainst the passage of this Rill; and that the\npress of those States is almost universally against\nit. Rut neither in the meetings, nor in the press,\ndo I see repentance. They nbonnd in indignation\ntoward perfidy:?bnt thej reveal no sorrow of the\nNorth for the crimes of the North against liberty.\nOn the contrary, the meetings and the press do\nwell nigh universally justify the Compromise of\n1820, and, in the great majority of instances, the\nCompromise of 1850, \"Fugitive Slave* Act,\" and\nall! Even iu sermons, preached against the Nebraska\nRill, 1 have seen the Fugitive Slave Act\njustified. Now, the idea, that they, who can approve\nof either of these Compromises, and especially\nthat they, who can, possibly, acquiesce in\nthe chasing down of men, women, and children,\nfor the purpose of casting them into the pit of\nslavery?the idea, I say, that such persons will\nperseveringly and effectively resist slavery, and\ndo faithful battle for it* overthrow, is to my mind\nsimply absurd. They, and they only, are to be\nrelied on for such service, who so loathe slavery,\nthat they would rather perish than do any of its\nbiddings, come those biddings from Congress, or\nfrom Courts, or from any other sources.\nAmi hid to strengthsn my hopo by looking at\nthe rapidly multiplying abolitionists ? I do look\nat them: and this cheering sight is all, that,\nunder God, keeps my hopo alive. But I fear, that\nthey are too late. 1 fear, that the disease is past\nenre. And I fear, too, that, even if w# are yet in\ntime to kill the Demon of Slavery, our falee and\npro-slavery education makes as so hesitating and\ntimid in hit terrific presence, that we shall not\nwage direct, deep, and faUil war upon him, but\nshall waste onr energies and onr only and swiftly\npassing away opportunity in ineffectual skirmishes\nand disgraceful dodgings. A few abolitionists\nare consistent: and, were they not so few, they\nwould be formidable. They know no law for any\nfraud; and, therefore, they will not know it for\nthe most stupendous fraud. They know no law\nfor any oppression ; and, therefore, they will know\nnone for the most sweeping oppression. Such\nabolitionists are Garrison and Phillips, Ooodell\nand Douglas* But most alwlitionretit, impliedly\nf 11, 1854.\nif not directly, tac itly if not openly, acknowledge, t\nthat slavery can have, and actually lias, rights : \\\nand they are as respectful to these supposed v\nrights, as if the subject of them were one of the (.\ngreatest earthly blessings, iustead of una of the u\ngreatsst earthly curses. *\nIt is true, that there is a political party in our c\ncountry, organised against slavery; and that it \\\nnumbers some two hundred thousand voters, t\namong whom are some of ths noblest men in the i\nland. And, yet, I look with well nigh as much e\nsorrow, as hope, to this party. For so long as it i\nrecognizes slavery as law, I fear, that ,notwitli- (\nstanding its high and holy purposes, it will do\nscarcely less to sanction and uphold slavery than j\nto reproach and cast it down. Again, so long as 1\nthis party is swayed by such words of folly and a\ndelusion, as \" Si.atuky sectional : Freedom ha- d\ntioxal,\" its admissions in favor of slavery cannot 1\nfail to go far to outweigh all its endeavors against r\nslavery.

Happy s\ncountry this?happy North?happy South?if the 1\npresent aggresstvo movement of the slave-power f\nshall result in bringing triumphant accessions to '\nthe Liberty Party 1 t\nMy fear, that the American Governments, 1\nState or National, will not abolish slavery, is, iu r\nno degree, abated by the fact, that several Huro- s\npoan Governments have, in the present generation,\nabolished it. It must be remembered, that 1\nthose Government* were exterior to, and independ- c\nent gf, the slave-power; and that they were not 5\ntrammelled by slaveholding constituencies. It is f\ntrue, that slavery in Mexico was abolished by the t\nGovernment in Mexico; and that slavery in South c\nAmerican States was abolished by the Govern- c\nmenu in those States. Hut it is also true, that 1\nall this was done to promote the success of their j\nRevolution and their deliverance from tho Gov- j\nernment of Spain. I doubt not, that even we, ,\nclosely as we cling to slavery, would, nevertheless, 1\nabolish it, if urged to do so by the exigencies of war.\nTo ho]>e. that, because the Knglish Government\nabolished slavory, our GovernmenU will also, is\nuntvise, in another point of view. Comparatively\ndisentangled with slavery as was England, slavery,\nnevertheless, exerted well nigh enough\npoVrer over her Government to prevent its successful\naction against slavery. The party in the\ninterest of slaTerv was barelv defeated.\nLet me no! be misunderstood. Let me not be [\nsupposed to fetw, that American slavery will not t\ne^me to an end. My fear is, that it will not ?\nbe brought to an end by Government. I have no 1\nfear, that it will not be abolished. It will be\nabolished-?and at no distant day. If the Gov- 1\neminent* fail to abolish it, it will abolish itself.\nThe colored people of this nation, bond and free,\nnumber four millions, and are multiplying rapidly.\nThey are ell viotims of slavery?for if the\nfree are not in the it\/nbro, they are. nevertheless,\nin the ftuutnbra, of slavery, llenre, then, as\nwell as by identity of race, they are bound together\nby the strongest sympathy.

In the nfost benighted portions\nof the earth, the victims of sueh a system would,\nin procosi of time, come to such a sense of their\nwrongs, and thoir power also, as to rise up and\nthrow oil' the system. Rut that, here, such a\nsySlem must he hurried to its end, is certain.\nFor, hern, it is entirely out of harmony with all\nthe institutions around it, and with all the nr.>fessiotisof\nthose, who uphold it. Here it iecontinually\npressed upon by ten thousand influences adverse\nto its existence. Nothing, so much as American\nslavery, stands iu the way of the progress of the\nage. A littletime longer, and it muit yield to\ntiiis progress, and be numbered with the things,\nthat were. The only question it. whether it shall\ndie a peaceful, or a violent, death ? whether it\nshall quietly recede before advancing truth, or\nresist unto blood.\nGod forbid, that American slavery should come\nto a violent end. I hold, with O'Connell, that no\nrevolution is worth the shedding of blood. A\nviolent end to American slavery would constitute\none of the bloodiest chapters in all the book of\ntime. It would be such a reckoning for deep\nand damning wrongs?such an outbursting of\nsmothered and pent-up revenge, as living man\nhas never seen. Can this catastrophe be averted?\nPerhaps, it cannot. Perhaps, God will not\nlet off this superlatively wicked nation on any\neasier terms than a servile war?a war, we inuet\nremember, that will he very like to bring within\nits wide sweep t.he whole black population of\nthis continent and the neighboring islands ? a\npopulation already numbering some ten or twelve\nmillions. Perhaps, since we would be a nation\nof oppressors, lie will let the oppressed smite the\noppressors. Perhaps, since we would be a bloody '\nnation. He will give us blood, even unto the\nhoree-hi idles.\" There will be no such catastrophe,\nhowever, if the North and the South,\nequal sinners in the matter of slavery, shall\nhasten to mingle the tears of their penitence;\nto say from the heart: \" We are verily guilty\nconcerning our brother;\" and to join their hands I\nin putting away their joint and nnsurp&ssed sin. I\nI shall be blamed for having treated my sub- 1\nject in the light of so severe a morality. It will 1\nbe said, that economical views of it would have c\nbeen more suitable and statesmanlike; and that r\nI should have dwolt uik>? the gains to the slave- t\nholder, and the gain* to the country, from the\nabolition of elarery. I confess, that, had korscs\nand oxen been the subject of mj speech, the field\nof economy would hare been wide enough for\nthe range of my thought*, and the course of my\nargumont. But I hare been speaking of men?of\nniiiliou*.of immortals: and I hare been claiming,\nthat Government should lift them up out of their\nchattelhood and their association with brutes:\nand I could not so disparage the dignity, and to\nsully the glory, of their manhood, es to claim the\nperformance of this high and holy duty, in the\nname of money. When I see my fellow-man\nreduced to a slave, I demand his deliverance,\nsimply because lie is a man. I cannot so wrong\nhis exalted nature and my own, and the Great\nOne, who made us in His own image, m to argue,\nthat money can be rnnde by surh deliverance. I\nwould as soon think of making a calculation of\npecuniary gains my argument in dissuading from\nthe crime of m order.\nIn saying, that I would not antler the duty of\ndelivering the slave to tnrn npon the question of\npecuniary gains and economical advantages, I\nutter no peculiar doctrine.

To convince the people that slavery odoht\nTO BE ABOLISHED. .\nII. To convince the people what each individu\nal OUGHT TO DO, IN ORDER TO ITS ABOLITION.\nThe first proposition (we insisted,) has already re\nceived the sanction of public opinion universally, if we\nexcept slaveholders and their apologists. Consequent\nly all efforts put forth hereafter in Vermont (or in the\nfree States even,) with a view to establish this point,\nmust necessarily be the ludicrous \"beating of the air,\nthe \"shaking of the bush,\" after the bird has been\ncaught and eaten. I offer this as a labor-saving sug\ngestion, and one which I would not have named, were\nit not for the fact, Unit very recently an anti-slavery\nconvert (not remarkably conversant with the history of\nthe cause) commenced his public career in behalf of\nthe slave with a discourse upon Jewish Abraiiamic\nSlavery a discourse so very far \"behind llw limes,\"\nthat it elicited the facetious (tho' friendly) remark, that\n\"by the time the worthy lecturer extends his anti\nslavery march down as far as to the days of the apos\ntles, slavery will be dead and buried.\"\nMy second and third proposition I now propose to\ndiscuss as briefly, and with as little attempt at rhetor\nical embellishment, as possible; hoping in this hum\nble effort not to gratify any feeling of vain ambition,\nwhich I may possess, but rather to induce, if possible,\nabler intellects and more philanthropic hearts to es\npouse a cause, which demands, and is fast enlisting\nthe sympathies and prayers and energies of the chris\ntian world. Slavery in the United States is divisi\nble into two kinds, or classes, the non-observanco of\nwhich distinction has occasioned much needless mis\nunderstanding and profitless debate.\nI. We have (what may properly be called) State\nSlavery.\nII. National Slavery.\nThe former depends for its existence, its legalised\nbeing and support, upon the legislative action of the\nindividual States, in which it prevails. In some States\nit claims the higher, protection of constitutional en\nactment, the protection of the State Constitution.\nWhereas our .alional slavery derives its original le\ngal existence from an Act of Congress ; and the same\nlaw still sustains it. When the Deed ot Cession of\nthe \"ten miles square\" took effect, that instant the\nslave laws of Maryland and Virginia ceased their ope\nrations within the ceded territory. Slavery then ceas\ned within the District. The former slaves were then\nnot only morally and naturally and righteously free,\nbut Uiey were legally free free in law and in right,\nas free as the members of Congress, who re-enslaved\nthem who kidnapped them by Act of Congress, and\nthus bound them and their posterity to the perpetual\ndespotism of the avaricious, lustful, Anglo-Saxon slave\nholder, the bitterest despotism with which the Al\nmighty ever suffered man to afflict his fellows. And\nthat same Slavery-creating law now remains upon\nour national Statute book, a burning disgrace both to\nthe legislators, who treacherously placed it there, and\nto the nation that has thus far unblushingly suffered it\nthere to remain.\nNow let us inquire, how these two kinds of slavery\nare to be met and abolished against what particular\nbranch of the system the men of Vermont are to make\ntheir assault, and consequently what are the weapons\nadavted to the war,\nIf slavery is ever peacefully terminated in these\nUnited States, it must be dune either, 1st, by individa\nal emancipation by the masters, 2d, by legislative en\nactment of the slave States in the case of State slave\nry, and of Congress in the case of National slavery, or\n3d, by the intei position of the National government in\ncither its J udicial or Military departments. I can con\nceive of no other peaceable meUiod of effecting the\nobject, unless we include, as one, the \"under-ground\nrailroad-\" and I hardly think that any friend of this\nprocess has the faith to believe that this can do more\nthan hasten the general emancipation by some of the\nmethods above named. Nor shall I take any further\nnotice of the third method specified, inasmuch as a\ndiscussion of that branch of the subject can have no\nbearing on the main question now under consideration,\nto wit: Uie duties and obligations of the men of Ver\nmont in relation to slavery. For our present purpose\nthen, the proposition stands thus : slavery, if peace\nfully abolished, must be abolished eiUier by individu\nal manumission, or by legislative enactment\nNow 1 ask, where is the man, who, conversant with\nthe two hundred year's past history of slavery, yet pos\nsesses so much charity for human nature, as to believe\nthat any one of these United States would ever, during\nall time, be disencumbered of slavery, by the voluntary\nact of the mosteis? Never can such an unearthly,\nsuch a heavenly result be expected, until that better\ntime shall arrive, in Revelation foretold, when the prin\nciples of righteousness shall have supplanted the pur\nposes of rapine, when wars and rumors of wars shall\nhave ceased, and \"there shall be none to hurt or des\ntroy in all God's holy mountain.\" Not until profanity\nand blasphemy and perjury and robbery and piracy\nand murder Bhall have been voluntarily abandoned, and\nthe legal enactments in suppression of those crimes\nbecome a dead letter upon the statute book of the land,\nneed one hope to see Uio slavery of a single State a\nbandoncd voluntarily. Nay, it is self-evident, that\nmen, who can coolly and systematically prostitute the\nprinciples and precepts and spirit of the blessed Bible\nto Uie blasphemous desecration of sanctioning Amer\nican slavery (which alone violates each and every com\nmand of the Decalogue) will relax their grasp upon\nthe throat of the slave never, until either the strong\narm of the law interposes in behalf of Uie quivering\nvictim, ordeath's icy fingers gather up the indurated\nheart-strings of the merciless oppressor.\nIf. the assumption Uien is correct (as substantiated\nby reason and experience both) that slavery will not\nterminate by voluntary manumission, it follows, that it\nmust bs abolished by legislation j our national slavery\nby Congress, and State slavery by State legislatures.\nAnd if slavery is to be thus terminated, the duties\nto be performed and the work to be done by the free\nmen of Vermont, are plain and obvious : so very man\nifest that Uie wayfaring man need not err in relation\nthereto ; and I confess, that it seems almost like insul\nting the commonest understanding to pursue the sub\nject further. For it must be evident, if our national\nslavery is to be abolished by Congress, we must have\na majority of the representatives and senators in Con\ngress and a President who will favor such abolition,\nsuch repeal of the slave laws, created by Congress.\nAnd how shall such be the character of our President\nand Congress, unless the electors in the several States\nmake it Buch by their votes at the town Ballot-boxes ?\nWill your Congressional representative candidate vote\nto repeal the national slavery? Will he (if elected)\nvote for no one for President of the United States (in\ncase of no choice by the people) except for one who is\nin favor of such repeal? If so, it is safe to vote for\nsuch candidate. Will your town representative and\nyour County senatorial candidates vote right, when\nthey come to elect a United States Senator? If so,\nthey are of the right sort. Will your candidate for\nVice President vote right in case of atie in the Senate?\nIf so, vote for him. Will your Presidential candidate\nrefuse to sign a bill repealing the slave laws of Con\ngress? If so, it is treason against the religion of God\nand the rights of humanity to vote for such candidate,\nor for electors who would do so.\nHere then, Brethren, is the grand secret of the con\ntinuation and the aggrandizement ot slavery. The\nslave power, by its artful management in keeping the\ntwo parties continually pitted against each other, on\nthe subject of \"We other great interests,\" has effectually\npalsied the only instrumentality which can be brought\nto bear effectually against slavery. The voting against\nslavery has been suppressed. That weapon, which\nunder God is destined to break the power of the op\npressor in our land, has been \"locked in the scabbard\"\nby the foolishness, the wickedness of party strife.\nPolitical party idolatry, is the great guardian shield,\nbehind which slavery has grown fat on the blood of its\nvictims, while the only hope of the slave's redemption\nhas boon suffered to be neglected and forgotten. Yes,\nit is the peaceful little slip, the noiseless ballot, the\nsilent but omnipotent vote, this, this it is, which\nGod has given, with which to open the door of the\nprisoner and let the captive go free.\n\" A weapon, which comes down as still,\n-As snow-flakes fall upon the sod,\nAnd executes a freeman's will\nAs Lightning does the will of God.\"\nIf these views are correct, when a servant of God\nstands up before the groat congregation in discharge\nof the sacred duties of his calling, and invokes Uie in\nterposition of his great Master in behalf of tho slaves,\nand that slavery may be brought to a speedy end,\nwhat more is that, than the prayer that God would\noperate upon the hearts of the people and induce them\nto vote down slavery? And ought nut such servant,\nthen, who thus prays, to make manifest the sincerity\nof his prayer by voting in consistency threwith ?\nBut, again, it is the duty of every freeman not only\nto vote in the manner before named, but also to use\nhis whole influence to induce others to do the same.\nHence tho necessity of withdrawing all support and\ncountenance from every party which is not organized\nupon the true and only anti slavery ground, to wit: to\nsupport no man for any of the offices above mentioned,\nunless he will use his whole constitutional power to\nabolish slavery. The reason of this is too plain to\nneed illustration. In this, as in many other matters, it\nis true that \"he that is not for us is against us;\" and\nhence the command, to \"come out and be separate.\"\nAnd inasmuch as \"in union there is strength,\" it is the\nduty of all who wish slavery terminated, to unite to\ngether for the common purpose of operating against\nthe system more effectually. If all the members of\nUie various churches in our land, or even within the\n'rce States,' would take the Bible as the rule of their\npolitical action, there would be no necessity of any\nnew or different associations. Our churches would\nall be anti slavery associations, and such, too, as would\ndemolish slavery without that opposition which the\nfriends of the cause have heretofore contended with\nthe opposition of the church itself the very severest,\nthe most distressing part of the anti slavery contest.\nBut all do not thus take the Bible as their guide; and\nuence nas arisen tne necessity ot anotner organization;\nand such is the Liberty Party, whose foundation is.\nJ the com. non brotherhood of man whose object is, the\nredemption and elevation of the slave and whose rule\nof action is, the Bible and the constitution. And\nwhenever this party shall be seduced to abandon their\ngreat and glorious object, and to repudiate their heav\nenly principles, and to return back again hungering\nafter the flesh-pots of Egypt, which they have once\nforsaken, then and not till then) will it be time to\ncharge the party with corruption.\nThus have I attempted to speak of one branch of\nlabor necessary, indispensably necessary, for the peace\nful termination of slavery. I know that prayers, and ex\nhortations, and entreaties are alo necessary, beside,\ndoubtless, other instrumentalities still. \"Prayer moves\nthe arm that moves the world.\" But all these are but\nso many agencies to bring men up to tike hold of Uie\ngreat moral and religious (as well as political) lever,\nvoting, which is to upheave the blood-cemented sys\ntem. State slavery, I have said, must be abolished by\nthe State legislatures. Any resolutions, any systems\nof church discipline in reference to slavery and slave\nholders, which we may adopt or devise, intended to\ncause the individual slaveholder to manumit his slaves,\nor tending to purify tho churches here in the free or in\nthe slave States, or calculated to incite men to politi\ncal action, either in the slave States or the free, we\nare bound to originate. The anti slavery torch,\nwherever lit up, must be raised on high to shine.\nThere is darkness enough in this land of Bibles; God\nknows it; the poor Blave, grinding in his chains\nknows and feels it: the church of Heaven is buried\nso far down beneath the wrecks caused by slavery, as\nto barely see the light of day; and if Uiftre is any\nlight any where, which can relieve the oppressive\ndarkness of Uie scenery, let it be borne aloft! Let\nits rays flash on Uie midnight around us. But still\nit muBt ever be remembered , that voting, and that\nonly, can demolish the old Bastile of slavery.\nHere I leave the first two points of the general prop\nosition stated, to wit., that three Uiings only, were at\nfirst requisite to abolish American slavery:\nI. To convince the people that slavery ought to be\nabolished.\nII. To convince them what each one ought to do to\nabolish it.\nIII. To persuade them to do what thet know to\nbe thftr nuTY in the matter.\nMy third point I leave for each individual to discuss\nlor iuuiseit with his conscience ana wnn nis uoa.\nRespectfully Yours, for the Oppressed,\nAug. 17, 1746. PHILEMON.\nFor ttit; Green Mountain Freeman.\nThe Western Democracy.\nOne of the most encouraging omens to the slave, is,\nthe symptoms of awakening manhood in the western\nserviles. The great master overseer, Calhoun, has\ncracked his whip in so many different directions, and\nhas become bo regardless of the cries of his boys, and\nthe fulfilment of the few small promises which was\ndeemed prudent to make, to secure perfect obedience,\nthat insubordination in the western division is prevail\ning to a great extent. They were hoaxed into the\nsupport of Texas with the promise of Oregon, and\nthen laughed at for their folly. The Brinkerhoofs\nand Wentworths began to murmur, and show the\nwhite of their eyes. They denounced the duplicity of\nUieir masters. They would not be caught in that trap\nagain. But their services were required to establish\nMcKay's overseer tariff law. Naked promises of ap\npropriations for western lakes, and rivers, and harbors,\nwould not bring them. So the bill was passed through\nboth houses, and lodged understandingly in the hands\nof their chief. The west once more obeyed orders.\nNo sooner done than Mr. Polk claps his veto upon\ntheir darling measure, and their hopes perish. The\nsouth chuckle the west grumbles. Good. They\nhave got the slave's reward all Uiey deserved hard\nwork and no pay. And, like their southern brethren\nin bonds, they show unmistakable Bigns of leaving\ntheir master's service. The keystone is loosened,\nready to fall from the arch of despotism. The north\nstar of freedom begins to shine upon their pathway,\nand may yet eclipse, to their vision, the lone star of\nTexas. They can't again be whipped into the same\nsubmissive harness. Serviles they will for a while\nlonger continue, but on different terms. Pay in ad\nvance will henceforth be their motto. And as slavery\nnever would live, except by fraud, bo it wjjl loose all\nits profits in legislation when it pays to the west the\nprice of its obedience. For every industrial interest,\nand every other interest, except that of getting office\nby the favors of the south of the free west is becom\ning more opposed to Uie interests of the slaveholders.\nThe south cannot live by favoring western interests\nsufficiently to secure western obedience. The west\ncan take care of themselves cheaper than to hire the\nsouth to take care of them. A forced union may exist\na while longer, cemented by the heat of party strife.\nBut a separation is inevitable. Sooner or later it must\ncome. Both parties know it; hence the anxiety of\nslavery to extend her empire. She is sensible that the\nties of interest, affection and confidence, are fast sun\ndering forever between them. The western leaders\nhave been goaded on by southern insolence to make\nthe admission. jAnd tho praries, and far distant west,\nrespond from every motive of interest and of freedom\nto hasten their redemption from that base system of\nvassalage which has checked their growth and paraly\nzed Uieir energies thus far. Let the friends of free\ndom take courage, the western Lion is rousing from\nhis lair, to execute the divorce, decreed by nature.\nVINDEX.\nFor the Green Mountain Freeman.\nA Parallel Case,\nA. says to B. \"You Liberty men have elected Polk\npresident, and got Texas into the Union.\"\nB. replies, \"I wholly deny your charge; we opposed\nhis election with our whole strength.\"\nA. \"You did not vote the Clay ticket, therefore Polk\nwas elected.\"\nB. \"I charge you, Mr. A., with doing me an essential\ninjury.

The experiment of a free government on the\nAmerican Continent will have proved a failure,\nto the sad sorrow of the sons of Liberty every\nwhere, and to the joy and comfort of tyrants\nand despots the world over. Unless the friends\nof Liberty in this land now rally and combine\nforgetting every minor difference and all mat\nters of smaller moment conquest and slavery\nwill be triumphant. The felloes of Artillery\nwill plough fields now brown with harvest the\nmusic of our water-wheels and spindles will be\ndrowned in the shrieks of the slave-coffle and\nfor the clang of the anvil and the work-shop,\nwill be heard the ring of the auctioneer's ham\nmer. One strong, united effort, put forth now,\nand Liberty may be safe. But it is now, or\nnever. Slavery is gaining new strength, new\ncourage, new hope, every day. Now, if ever,\nis the fell spirit to be rebuked, and sent back to\nhis native pit\nFellow Citizens, shall this land become a\ngreat kennel for the breeding and traffic of slaves!\nThis beautiful land. This mighty land. Stretch\ning from ocean to ocean, and from the frozeu\nnorth to the very tropics. Rich in its mineral\nwealth, beyond almost any other land of the\nworld. Rich in its agricultural resources be\nyond comparison. Glorious in its mighty rivers\nand its broad deep inland seas, and crowned\nwith glory in its majestic mountains, pillowing\ntheir heads in the clouds and green to their very\nsummits with a rich verdure, and covered nil\nover with herds and lowing cattle. Aland pur\nchased with the life-blood of a great-hearted\nancestry. Say, fellow citizens, will you give it\nup to the damning purposes of slavery? The\nwhole matter is in your hands. All power em\nanates from the people. The rulers the infa\nmous rulers, of this land, are but your servants.\nThe friends of slavery the propagators of des\npotism, have combined for the sustenation rnd\nspread of their darling institution. Friends of\nLiberty and Justice and Humanity, lovers of\nGod and Man, will you cast aside everything!\nelse, and meet this naked question of Freedom\nor Slavery, that is now being pressed upon you?\nIf so, the Republic is safe! If otherwise, if\nthe people of the north remain indifferent, or\nfoolishly waste their time and strength in conten\ntion about the ten thousand matte is of small\nconsequence that divide us in rcligioui and po-\nlitical faith, the nation goes down. Goes down\ninfamously, through our recreancy and folly.\nThe slave power of this land is bent on the\nconquest of the whole American Continent, and\nits entile prostitution to the blighting curse of\nslave labor and its subserviency to slave inter\nests! This is the question now before the Amer\nican people and about to he settled. We are\nfearful of the result. Sixty year's union with\nthe blighting curse, seems to have palsied the\nhearts of the people, and our old Anglo-Saxon\nblood courses sluggishly through our veins.\nBehold this infamous Mexican conquest. Why\nare not the bells clanging in all our steeples,\nand the people leaving harvest-field and work\nshop, and flocking together to record their united\nProtest against, the vile, traitorous, heaven-defying\naction of this government?\nMassachusetts State Liberty Address.\nEXTRACT.\nIt is not easy to fill our minds with an ade\nquate view of the responsibility which attaches\nto the act of voting. It is by that act chiefly,\nthat the people govern. When you have given\njour vole, you have put the matter out of your\nhands ; but yet you remain responsible to Heav\nen and to Humanity for the consequences of that\nvote. This is a serious view of the matter, and\nit is just. Let those look to it, who made Ty\nler President, and enabled him to carry the an\nnexation of Texas, all but the last act ; and to\nstation the army on the borders of Mexico,\nwhich has produced the present war. Let those\nbolt to it, whose votes made Polk President, to\ncarry out so consistently what his predecessor\nhad begun. It was the votes of freemen that\ncreated those Senators, who made John C. Cal\nhoun Secretary of State by acclamation. It was\nby voting that Winthrop was enabled to recant\nthe declared opposition of Massachusetts to the\ndeed of annexation, and the war which followed.\nAnd votes placed Briggs in n position where he\ncould enrol our glorious Commonwealth as a vol\nunteer, to display !ier patriotism in carrying on\nthis war of invasion and conquest against a sis\nter republic. Take care, then, fellow citizens,\nhow you vote. The accumulated public senti\nment of a whole year, like a great balance wheel,\nexpends its momentum by a single act, upon the\noperation of our government and the destiny of\nour country, beyond recall. See to it, then, that\nyour votes so record your will, that you will nev'\ner have cause to regret them. The Liberty Par\nty are clear of the responsibility of these ming\nled calamities and crimes, by having given all\ntheir votes in unison with their declarations a-\ngainst the authors of every one of these meas\nures, and against the party influences under\nwhich these measures have been carried.\nt\nWe shall not insult your understanding by\nproceeding to prove that both the annexation of\nTexas and the war which has followed it origin\nated with the slaveholders, and are the legiti\nmate fruits of slavery. Texas was notoriously\nannexed to strengthen slavery against abolition;\nto create a wider market for the homebred slaves,\n\" the vigintial crop\" of Virginia and the older\nslave states ; to furnish a new soil for slave la\nbor as fast as the curse of barrenness spreads\nover the present slave territory ; and above all,\nby a Bonapartean movement of overeeerisrn, by\nthe Slave Power, to cripple and confound the\npoliticians, parties and people of the country,\nand produce a salutary awe of their despotic\nmasters, which may suppress even the utterance\nof a desire to break away from their usurped do\nminion. How completely they have succeeded,\nlet the craven spirit which now pervades Con\ngress, let the tone even of the Boston press, tell.\nAnd the conquests made in this war, lo which\nyou have been summoned by your own Execu\ntive, will doubtless enure to the extension of the\ndominion of slavery over all the territory that\nmay be acquired. Nothing can be more idle\nthan it is for papers and politicians, themselves\ncourting and supplicating the slaveholders, to\nprattle about prohibiting the further extension of\nslavery by the power of the United States, or\nthe admission of more slave States, as fast as\nterritories can furnish a scanty population. The\nonly influential opposition to the extension of\nslavery, is that which puts slavery itself upon\nthe defensive, and drives it to the wall to strug\ngle for its own existence.\nThe present posture of affairs furnishes over\nwhelming proof, were it needed, to satisfy every\nreflecting mind of the utter incapacity of the\nexisting old parties, or either of them, to offer\nany effectual resistance to the encroachments and\nusurpations of the Slave Power. When we\nspeak of these parties, we mean to be under\nstood cf their combined action as organized\nparties, marshalled under certain leaders, and\nstruggling for certain objects in which slavehold\ners and non-slaveholders have a common inter\nest. In both these parties, slaveholders rule with\nabsolute sway, and thus secure thr verification\nof Mr, Clay's declaration, that neither of these\nparties has any view to the emancipation of the\nslaves as a part of its policy.\nIt shows, too, in the light of almost a centu\nry's experience, the insufficiency of our institu\ntions to circumscribe this giant evil, or to pro\ntect the liberties of the people against its en\ncroachments. From the clay wnen Jonn Ad\nams told Samuel Adams that it was necessary lo\ngive the South the command in order to secure\ntheir fidelity to the infant revolution ; and espe\ncially from the adoption of the present constitu\ntion of our Union, the Slave Power has gone on\nwith a steady and continual progress of assump\ntion, now using the Democratic party as its allies\nto give it new conquests, and then employing\nthe conservative influence of the Anti-Demo\ncratic party to secure its acquisitions. The ad\nmission of Missouri and the annexation of Tex\nas as Slave States, are but stages in its career of j\nusurpation. For fifty-seven years the friends of\nfreedom have maintained an ineffectual strugi\nin defence, but have been baffled in every in\nstance, have never gained one victory, have been\ncontinually driven back, have given the slave\nholders first the balance and then the control\nof the Senate, have grown weaker, and more\nsubmissive, and less hopeful, until at length, on\nthe annexation of Texas, multitudes of North\nern men gave up in despair, and were ready to\nagree to serve without complaint or resistance,\nprovided only, that the conquerors would merci\nfully consent to spare them the pecuniary bene\nfits of a protective tariff a few years longer.\nEven this humiliating surrender has been treat\ned with scorn, and the blow which was so sla\nvishly deprecated by the Whigs of New Eng\nland and the Democrats of Pennsylvania, has\nbeen struck by the slaveholders, without deign\ning a word of pity or explanation. There is no\nlonger any power left of giving further rerist\nance ; and the haughty overseers believe that\nnow they can have everything their own way.\nThere is no hope that the Free States can ev\ner escape from this thraldom, but by a radical\nchange of policy on the subject of slavery. WE\nMUST TAKE THE AGGRESSIVE! We\nare driven back to the wall, and must turn. We\nmust henceforth unite in a firm resolve, not only\nto resist the further encroachments of slavery,\nbut to employ the powers wnich the constitution\ngives us, with inflexible firmness, to promote the\npeaceful extinction of slavery itself. Here is\nour only hope. Unless the non-slaveholders of\nthe country, North and South, can now be ral\nlied on this ground, it is manifest that nothing\nawaits us but a still deeper degradation, and a\nstill more disastrous domination of the Slave\nPower. Have we not bowed down long enough?\nThe example of New Hampshire shows that the\npeople think so, and that they are ready now to\nlay aside every other question, and unite on Anti-Slavery\nground, just as soon as their leaders\nwill let them. Now is the time aiid now the\nhour to raise high the banner of the Liberty\nparty, which was organized six years ago foi\nthis very purpose, and which can never be turn\ned aside from its one object, THE PEACE\nFUL AND CONSTITUTIONAL ABOLI\nTION OF SLAVERY.\nAnd we are quite sure this can be done, if\nthe non-slaveholders will only unite their exer\ntions, on the basis of constitutional and uncom\npromising opposition to slavery. A brief view\nof what we could do will show how infallibly cer\ntain it is, that the principles and policy of the\nLiberty party, if persevered in, will destroy\nslavery from the whole country, without en\ncroaching upon the rights of a single individu\nal, or offering the least violence to the constitu\ntion. In the first place, there would be the abolition\nof slavery and the slave tiade in the District of\nColumbia. Slaves are now held and bought aud\nsold in that District, solely by authority of the\nAct of Congress, extending the laws of Mary\nland over the District. Had Congress incorpo\nrated in that act a single 'clause, to the effect of\n\"excepting all such laws as are supposed to au\nthorise the holding mankind as slaves,\" slavery\nwould have ceased the moment the District pass\ned under the authority of the Federal Govern\nment An act repealing so much of the laws\nof Maryland as may authorise slavery, would\nfree every slave in the District; and the same\nlaws which now prevent kidnapping in Massa\nchusetts, would consign to the penitentiary eve\nry man who should attempt lo re-enslave the\nfreed people. So general is the belief that this\nought to be done, that nothing but the political\ncontrol of the slaveholders has prevented it from\nbeing done long since. It is highly probable\nthat other parties will eagerly forestall the Liber\nty party in doing this deed of justice, as soon\nas this party gives those decided proofs cf spee\ndy growth and certain triumph, which leave no\nroom for uncertainty. The Anti-Corn-Law\nLeague in England, which was - the exact coun\nterpart of the Linerly party, so far as the differ\nent constitutions and usages of the two coun\ntries would allow, lias carried all its objects, and\nDissolved by its own limitation, before it had\nelected twenty members of parliament. Our\nobject is larger, more amplicated, and less di\nrectly in the power of Congress, but we may\nhope that so far as the District of Columbia is\nconcerned, it will be done by others by the time\nwe shall have carried half a dozen States. Mr.\nCalhoun assures us that the District is THE\nKEY OF SLAVERY. And when we have\ngained this Gibraltor, we shall need no prophet\nto promise us the w hole Ian:!.\nThe exclusion of slaveholders from office, is\nour next potent weapon. The slaveholder is\nguilty of a high crime, and all such ought to be\nexcluded from the honors of office. This crime\nis peculiarly anti-republican, and its effects upon\nour country is most disatrous, making every\nman who upholds it worthy to be considered a\npublic enemy. It is suicidal, therefore, for us\nto trust and honor slaveholders. Now consider\nhow devoted the slaveholders are to politics, how\ndependent large sections of the South are upon\nthe public crib, and how diligently the slave\nparty avails itself of political power, and we\nsee that this one principle strikes out the main\npillar of the whole system, and slavery must fall.\nLet us have anti-slavery men in every post-office\nand custom-house and land office, throughout the\nSouth. Let them understand that they can have\nno mail, which is not superintended by a non\nsleveholder. Let it be known that no man can\nbe retained in any office, high or low, who holds\nslaves. Let the people of the United Slates de\nclare by their votes, that no slaveholder can\never hope to be president or vice president of the\nUnited States, or judge, or embassador, or sec\nretary, or commissioner, or even a clerk in the\nDepaitinenis, who has not foresworn slavery,\nand the politicians of Kentucky aud Virginia,\nand even of South Carolina and Mississippi, will\nhaste to qualify themselves for public honor, by\nnot only freeing their own slaves, but by exerting\nthemselves to rid their States of the evil. How\nsoon if the people of the North were in earnest,\nwould Delaware and Maryland and Missouri, be\nadded to the list of free States. The whole sys\ntem would be driven from the country in less\ntime than any of us dare to mingui&ias\nDancing. The churches are making dancing a sub\nject of discipline, declaring it to be intolerably immor\nal. How dare Uiey do it? Is'nt dancing as much a\nBible institution as slavery?

This\narmy is also charged with the purification and\nexaltation of American character, by creating a\nbond of union between the abstractions of hu\nman freedom and the living practicalities by\nbridging that hitherto yawning gulf; and this\narmy is charged with the utter extirpation of\nthat desolating hypocrisy, which so long in\nChurch and State, destroyed the use of language,\nin suffering a holy abstraction, in religion or\npolitics standing as our creed, to be a license\npractically, to act out all manner of abomina\ntions; the purity of the creed making atonement\nfor the profligacy of the conduct under it.\nThis army of freedom is charged with rescuing\nthe character of this great nation from the burn\ning sneers and unanswerable arctocisms of old\nEurope, who declared that as hope for man as\ncended high, reality dugdungeeiis deep and low,\nin which to hide our shame.\nThis army is charged with the faithful exe\ncution of the Declaration of Independence ; the\ngnat unperformed, the gnaty admired, but un\navailable. For seventy years the tuition has\nbeen so overwhelmed, with the truthfulness and\ngrandeur of its conception, that they have been\ncontent to stand nil of this time and shout their\nadmiration, before an astonished world, and an\nnually arrest the very wheels of human affairs,\nwhile on the 4th of July, we stretched the ut\nmost power of human genius for the strongest\nconceptions of in'ellect, and for the most con\nsuming thoughts, to be delivered in the most\nbeautiful robes of language, to stamp that im\npression of veneration on the mind of others, ns.\ndeeply, as it had sunk in our own. We stand\nlooking at this splendid ship of State, yet on the\nstocks, her masts raised, yards trimmed, canvass\nspread, and ballast in, and provisioned for a cir\ncumnavigation of the whole circle of human ne\ncessities, with orders to call at every port, island\nand country in her course; carrying justice,\nlaw, equal rights, to- all men, furnishing them\nwith a remedy for the wrongs inflicted lor ages,\npossessing the sure and certain power of strik\ning fetters and bonds from the legs and arms of\nmen, with the power of opening prison doors and\nthe placing the victims on the great platform of\nequal and eternal rights, and giving them power\nto make the laws they are required to honor, and\nin future, the obligations they are bound to\nobey.\nThe Liberty party is charged with the high\nduty of launching and navigating the old ship\nof American Independence, which has stood for\na launch from the 4th of July, 17(3, while the\nseas have swarmed with pirates, and buccaniers,\nwho have even come upon her deck and sworn\nby her stripes and colors, that she never shall be\nlaunched, as long as wood grows and water runs.\nThese pirates and freebooters have sucked the\nfree blood of the nation from its veins, and now\nthreaten the lives of those who may endeavor to\nlaunch this ship, and declare that she was never\nmade to go to sea ; she was only made to stand\neternally on the stocks as an object of unex-\nplainable admiration, as an abstract ship, to be\ndeified on the stocks, on the fourth of July, and\npoint the orations of Juniors and Sophomores, at a\nCollege commencement ; and in fact they say, if\nyou do launch her, they will bore holes in bet\nbottom, and siuk her and all her glorious freight,\nas she was meant to be a ship only on land and\nnot on the water ; and these pirates are ready to\nprove, that one of the old ship carpenters w ho\nbuilt her at Philadelphia, was heard by one of\nthe pirates to snyy that the ship was not made to\ngo on the water, but' was intended solely for the\nland. And many say, who are not pirates, that\nwe must search for ihe intention of the old\nship-builders and hands who framed and made\nthis ship ; if some of them did say that it was\ntheir intention that this ship should sail on the\nland, then we, their posterity, are bound to sail\non the land, though the ship itself would con\ntradict it, even if every builder should swear the\nwas to sail on the land !\nWill the army of liberation put themselves in","11":"70\nemancipation for the liberation of all its slaves,\nsay at the end of one, two, ten, or tweuty years,\nsuch State might, at the very next census after\npassing suck act, claim a full representation for\nthese slaves, because the act takes them from\nthe class of *\" all other persons,\" and places them\nwith those bound to service for a term of\nyears.\" The matter i9 so plain, that a clear\nstatement of it only seems necessary to convince\na disinterested and unprejudiced mind of its\ntruthfulness.

We, for instance, regard the continuance\nof Human Slavery as at ooce a great crime\nand a great blunder ? as the main inciting\ncause of our country's misfortunes and perils.\nWe do inost earnestly believe that Virginia,\nfor example, would have had double the popu\nlation and treble the wealth she now has, had\nher soil never been pressed by the foot of a\nslave. So >>! North ( arolina, Kentucky, Ten\nnessee; ?o, emphatically, of Maryland, Missouri,\nTexas. But even we have no idea that the\nFederal (Government ever will or should undertake\nto intermeddle with the existence of Slavery\nin any State of this Union. We ask that\nGovernment simply to let Slavery in tlie States\nalone, protecting the inviolability of its mails\nand that personal liberty which the Federal\nConstitution guaranties to every citizen, leaving\nthe overthrow of Slavery to the natural\ngrowth and diffusion of intelligence, humanity,\nand religion. That the Federal Government\nshould cease to lie the active champion and\npr?p^Ui<li?t of Slavery, whether in its domesm\ntic or its foreign policy, we do urge and insist.\nBeyond that point we do not ask nor expect it\nto ?0.\nThe annexation of Texas, under the circumstances\nand conditions of that annexation, the\noverthrow of the Missouri compact, the whole\ncourse of Federal proceedings in Kansas, from\nthe hour that Border Ruffians were first permitted\nto harass and abuse her Free-State settlers\nwithout resistance or rebuke from those\nappointed and paid to administer the laws there,\ntlown to the culmination of the Lecomptou\nfraud, we hold to be gross departures from that\nattitude which it was the duty of the Federal\nGovernment to maintain with regard to Freedom\naiwl Slavery. So with the monstrous project\nof paying one hundred millions or over for\nthe Island of Cuba, for the single purpose of\nconstituting a new buttress and support of the\nslave power in our l'nion. Surely it cannot be\nnecessary that one should be a deadly foe of\nSlavery, in order that he should realize the\ngross partiality and injustice of such projects\nas this. We do not ask the Federal Government\nto nd 11. i.' i - to strengthen the i'reelabor\nnterest in our l'nion. We protest\nagainst spending millions lor an opposite purpose.\nWho savs that this protest is not justified?\nNor do we ask nor desire the proscription of\nslaveholders or Pro-Slavery men by the Federal\nAdministration. If they insist on proscribing\nus, why then they raise an issue which we\nmust meet, and the hardest fend otf. But we\nare quite willing to return to the policy of the\nearly IYesidents, under whom no man s opinions\nre?|?ecting Slavery were made a test of his\nfitws? h?r office.

It\nis said he had fifty men in the room, to be\nused, if necessary, as special bailiffs. It looked\nominous for a time, and the Kentucky witnesses\nwere evidently thankful they had no bail to offer,\nand could be committed to the keeping of\nthe Marshal.\"\nThe Morning Leader of Saturday has the fol\nlowing iu relation to Mr. uusnnell, the convicted\nparty:\n' Yesterday, Marshal Johnson deniande<l of\nthe Sheriff the mittimus on which ISushtiell had\nbeen held by him.

If they are all\nfound guilty, and made to suffer the penalty of\nthe law, they will believe themselves persecuted\nand made to suffer for righteousness' sake ; and\nif they are suffered to go without punishment,\nthey will consider it as another triumph of\ntruth over evil.

Not a Southern newspaper, not\na Southern authority, accepted the proposition\nof the Tribune, but a general cry was raised\nthat it was inadmissible. The Southern Oppo j\nsition would have all, or none. Not a single\nRepublican press, or politician or convention\nof any note, assented to the proposition, but in\nI ..ii o.ii .v..\ntill ijuai icio lb it'll uuurt ntc uinop^i uuaiiuu vi\nthe friends of Freedom. Was not this enough\nto satisfy the Tribune?\nWhat occurred afterwards ? It contented\nitself with hinting occasionally at \" fusion,\"\nbut seemed to acquiesce in the clear decision\nof the Party. Republicans were bold and uncompromising,\nutterly repudiating iu practice\nthe policy of the Tribune, and so they achieved\nan uninterrupted succession of triumphs. The\n. victories they won were Republican, not Opposition\nvictories. They were not intolerant, not\nproscriptive, but, constituting the only organized\nParty opposed to the Administration,\nthey defined their own issues, pursued their\nown course, leaving Old Whigs, Conservatives,\nand Native Americans, to vote with them or\nwith a profligate, Pro-Slavery Administration,\nas their consciences should dictate.\nThat was the true plan, and its wisdom has\nbeen fully attested by^the result. What the\nParty has done in the States, let it repeat in the\nFederal contest of 1860, and the country will\nwitness a similar result.\nIs it not marvellous that after the \" fusiou \" j\npolicy has been so utterly repudiated in all sections,\nand by all parties, the Tributie should\nagain present its disorganizing proposition^\nagain attempt to persuade the Republican Party\nto commit suicide ? Having opened our j\ncolumns for a discussion of the Presidential j\nOuestion. we insert the editnrial nf the TVihtms 1\nunder that head, so that our readers may see\n; clearly how flimsy is the argument in support t\nof such a policy.\nThe proposition virtually contemplates the\ntransfer of the Republicans to the Old Whig\nground: if carried out generally, the Opposition\nwould be in substAnce a Whig Party, under\nConservative leadership, controlled by Conser- ;\nvative usages. That is, the Slavery Question\nwould be ignored, evaded, or subordinated, and\nsuch men as Winthrop, Fillmore, Bates, and\nBotts, would be restored to power. The country\nwas favored once with a Whig Party, just\nlike this, and what did it accomplish for Freedom?\nHow many words in behalf of Human\nRights did it utter in the Congress of the United\nStates ? Did it prevent the annexation of Texaa\nwith Slavery? Did it prevent the war against\nMexico to extend the area of Slavery ? Did it\nprevent the passage of the Fugitive Slave Bill,\nthe abandonment of the Proviso, the repeal of\nthe Missouri Compromise ? Was it ever able\nto save Anti-Slavery men from political proscription\n? Did it not, with the hue and cry\nof a grand Opposition rally, elect John Tyler,\nwho committed himself to the Texas annexation\npolicy? Did not the Whigs of the Senate ratify\nunanimously the nomination of John C. Cal- j\nhoun as Secretary of State, and did not the\nWhig Press applaud the apppointment?a man\nwho rested the whole policy of annexation on\nPro-Slavery grounds, and advocated before the\nworld the institution of Negro Slavery! Did\nnot that party, with the same hue and cry for a\ngrand rally of the Opposition, elect Millard\nFillmore, to whose Whig Cabinet and Administration\nwe owe the passage of the Fugitive\nBlacks Act, and the abandonment of the AntiSlavery\npolicy of the Ordinance of 1787 ? JJid\nnot that Party, at Baltimore, in 1852, swear by\nthe Compromise of 3850, and even Mr. Greeley\nvote for the candidate of the Platform, while\nspitting upon the Platform itself? Did not the\nWhigs of the South, in the struggle of 1854\nconcerning the Missouri Compromise, desert\ntheir Northern associates, unite with Pro-Slavery\nDemocrats, and carry the repeal ? Did\nthey not, together with Conservative Whigs of\nthe North, as they are called, in 1856, unite\nin support of Millard Fillmore, thereby deieating\nthe Republicans, and electing James Buchanan\n?\nAnd now the proposition is coolly made, to\ngo back to all this*\" wallowing in the mire ! \"\nTo reconstruct a National Whig Party, with\nthe same reasonable^ wonderfully efficient policy,\nwhich marked the career of National Whiggery\nfrom 1840 to 1854!\nThe Tribune seems willing to do almost anything\nfor the sake of \" fusion.\" It will not insist\non a reaffirmation of the Republican platform,\nor the selection of a Republican candidate\nfor the Presidency; it would cheerfully support\nBell, Bates, or Botts, and ask no more than\n\"that the Federal Government should cease to\nI + !,?-? onln'i* nkftiv* ?

The Ethiopian may change\nhis skin, and the leopard his spots, and the\nwolf and the lamb love each other like brothers.\nIt sees not the slightest difficulty in the\nway of the harmonious co-operation of those\nwho hate Slavery, and those who sneer at such\nhatred as fanaticism ; of those who believe that\nman cannot hold man as property, and those\nwho boast that the larger portion of all their\nwealth consists in that hint? of property!; of\nthose who assert the right of Congress to prohibit\nSlavery in the Territories, and those who\ndeny it; of those who affirm the right of the\nPeople of a Territory to exclude Slavery, and\nthose who deny it; of those who insist that the\nA.TIONAL ERA: WASE\nTerritorial Legislature ought to interdict, and\nthose who insist that it ought to protect it; of\nthose who contend that the Constitution of the\nUnited States regards slaves always as \" persons,\"\nand those who maintain that it always\ntreats them as \" property ;\" of those who declare\nthat Slavery is against natural right, can\nexist only by positive statute, and does not\nexist under the Federal Constitution in Federal\nTerritory, and of those who declare that Slavery\nis not against natural right, exists as\na normal institution, does exist under the Federal\nConstitution, and is protected under its\nguaranties in Federal Territory; of those who\ndenounce the Fugitive Slave act as barbarous\nand unconstitutional, and those who sustain it\nas reasonable and constitutional!\nGood Heavens! What can we expect of the\nmasses of the People, when this Tribune, so\ntruculent in the expression of its Anti-Slavery\nopinions, so zealous a propagandist of AntiSlavery\nsentiments, can seriously put forth a\nproposition, no more reasonable or feasible,\nthan would be a project for bridging over the\ngulf between Heaven and Hell, and placing\nthe universe under the joint sovereignty of 1\nGod and Satan ?\n\" Nor do we ask nor desire the proscription i\nof slaveholders or Pro-Slavery men by the Fed- i\neral Government,\" says the Tribune. \"If they\ninsist upon proscribing us, why then they\nraise an issue which we must meet, and the\nhardest feud off?

For the\ntwenty-five years the battle has been going 6n\nbetween Freedom and Slavery, and throughout\nall that period it has been the settled policy of\nslaveholders and Pro-Slavery men to exclude\nearnest Anti-Slavery men from Federal offices\nOf trust and influence ; but the Tribune talks as\nif such a policy were something quite novel,\nextraordinary, not yet determined upon. \" If\nthey insist upon proscribing us, why, then,\nthey raise an issue which we must meet!\"\nThis would be laughable, if the subject were not\nso serious. \" If,\" and \" if,\" and \" if\"?what\nin the name of common sense have they been\ndoing for a quarter of a century but this very\nthing, which the Tribune says, \" must raise an\nissue ?\"\nThe charity of the Tribune is as long as its\nmemory is short. \" Nor do we ask nor desire\nme proscription 01 siavenoiaers or rro-siaverv\nmen by the Federal Adminstration.\" What\ndo you desire then ? Do you expect any Administration,\nelected to carry out certain measures,\nto choose for its instruments or agents\nmen, pledged to thwart its policy? If a Tariff\nAdminstration exclude Free Trade men from\nits Councils, and fill offices of political influence\nwith agents concurring with its views\non the subject of a Tariff, is that \"proscrip- (\ntion ? \" Would not any other course be weak\nand silly, or raise the presumption of insincerity\nand treachery on the part of the Administration ?\nThe People are not proscriptive when they ,\nvote for men who represent their views on (\ngreat questions at issue, and against men of (\nopposite opinions, any more than he is pro- (\nscriptive who employs a blacksmith, instead of\na locksmith, to shoe his horse; nor is a President\nproscriptive, who, elected by a majority of (\nthe People to annex Texas or purchase Cuba,\nfor the purpose specially of strengthening Sla- ]\nvery, selects his agents with a definite view to\ntheir fitness for promoting that end. ,\nThe Tribune may speak for itself on this\npoint; but the Republicans, while they sin- j\ncerely disclaim a proscriptive spirit, would be ,\nfalse or foolish, if they did not intend to do\njust what the Tribune deprecates?exclude\nfrom offices of trust and influence Pro-Slavery\nmen. How. otherwise, could they exclude Proslavery\nideas? Do men gather grapes of\nthorns, or figs of thistles ? Mr. Bates accepts !\nthe obiter dicta about Slavery under the Con- |\nsuiuiiim in lerrnones, as a uecision, nnai and\nobligatory upon every Department of the Government:\nif President, would he appoint\nJudges, and Attorneys, and Marshals, for the\nTerritories, openly committed to a contrary\nopinion ? Mr. Seward denies that these extrajudicial\nopinions of the Supreme Bench have\nany binding force, and asserts that they are not\ngood law: if President, would he fill the Federal\noffices in the Territories with men openly\ncommitted to them ?\nWe might run through the whole list of\nquestions embraced in this great controversy\nbetween Freedom and Slavery, and point out\nthe utter irreconcilability of the creeds of the\nPro-Slavery and the Auti-Slavery Parties.\nThe Issues have been raised?the Tests have\nbeen made?the country must have an Anti- I\nSlavery or a Pro-Slavery Administration.

We have all eaten of the fruit of the\ntree of knowledge of Good and Evil: we can- j\nnot unlearn what we have learned: it now I\nonly remains that we should choose between\nthem. If the majority of the American People\nbe Pro-Slavery, let them elect a Pro-Slavery\nAdministration ; if a majority be Anti-Slavery,\nlet them elect an Anti-Slavery Administration. '\nHow can the Tribune, which has hithertp been\nreputed a Republican paper, and supposed to\nbe the advocate of a positive policy, now devote\nits energies to the suppression of this great\nIssue, to the exclusion of any decision of this\nParamount Question?\nIts one idea is, success; and by success we j\nare to understand the overthrow of the present\nAdministration, without any certain guaranty\nin relation to the principles and policy of the\nnew Administration. For one, we go into no\npolitical contest, without first knowing definitely\nfor what we are to contend, what paramount\nprinciple or measure is to be the issue. There\nmust be no guesswork, no trusting to chance,\nno quackery. We will not cheat, nor consent\nto be cheated. The Republican Party, preserving\nits integrity, and ascendant in a ma\njority of the Free States, although not in possession\nof the Federal Power, is far more efficient\nfor the protection of the great interests\nof Freedom, and as a safeguard against the\nusurpations of Slavery, than it could ever be,\nshould it succeed in obtaining Federal Power>\nby the sacrifice of its integrity, and the surrender\nof its principles.\nIn 1856, the Tribune was in favor of a clear\nRepublican organization, although Know Nothingism\npresented a most formidable front, and\nit was quite uncertain to what extent the People\ncould be rallied under the Republican banner.\nThe experiment was made. Republicanism\nwas demonstrated to be dominant in the\nhearts of the People of the Free States; the\nPro-Slavery Democracy triumphed over it only\nthrough the diversion made by the Fillmore\nParty, which hoped to carry enough States to\nthrow the election into the House. It carried\none State, and decided the election in favfcr\nof Slavery. From that hour, the FillmoCe\nParty ceased to exist as an organisation, atd\nthe Republican Party grew stronger aid\nstronger, being confessedly the only Party Capable\nof contesting the ground with the Black\nDemocracy. Joined by disaffected Democrats,\nby Whiga, Conservatives, and Know Nothings,\nwhose eyes had been opened by the respite pf\nthe struggle of 1856, it obtained the control\n1INGT0N, D. G, MAY\neven of those States which had given their electoral\nvotes to Mr. Buchanan. Meantime, his\nabominable policy in relation to Lecompton, Cuba,\nand Slavery Propagandism generally, distracted\nhis own Party, alienated many of its\nBtancheat supporters, and it became quite evident\nthat, should the two parties, the Pro-Slavery\nDemocracy and the Republican, be permitted\nto meet each other again, face to face,\non the Presidential battle-field, the result must\nbe a Republican victory. How could there be\nany doubt? Know Nothingism, as a] distinct\npolitical agency, had generally disappeared;\nOld Whiga and Conservatives had become Republicans\nor Democrats, or retired from active\npolitics ; the people were fast becoming organized,\nas Democrats or Republicans, and there\nwas no indication of the formation of a third\nparty strong enough to determine the struggle\nbetween them.\nWhat could have prompted the Tribune at\nsuch a moment to assume that a third party\nwas in existence, whose prejudices must be\nconsulted?that the Republican party could not\nwin success by adherence to its own organization\nand policy?that Conservatives, Whigs,\nKnow Nothings, Slaveholders, and Pro-Slavery\nmen, must be conciliated, and Republicans must\nforego, if necessary, their own organization, their\nprinciples, their men, for the sake of uniting\nwith those discordant classes, and forming a\ngreat Opposition, weak enough to forswear all\nPrinciple, strong enough to poll a majority of\nthe votes of the country ?\nhave said enough to show the utter reHJmnce^f\ni^ich a policy to sound principle:\nJne remark more, and we shall dismiss the subject\nfor the present. The scheme of the Tribune\nis impracticable. Such a combination as\nit recommends can never be formed. The Black\nDemocracy is still strong throughout the free\nStates. See it casting only two thousand fewer\nvotes than the Republicans in enlightened Connecticut!\nIn nearly all the Free States, it is\nthe adhesion of the earnest Anti-Slavery men to '\nRepublican Party that turns the scale against the\nits antagonist. A partial disaffection of this\nelement would reverse the state of things.\nLet the politicians beware how they trifle with\nthe conscfences of men who care for 110 success\nbut that of the Right. On both sides of the\ngreat Question are large bodies of men, entertaining\ndecided convictions, who detest trickery\nand compromise. Let such such an\nOpposition be formed, as the Tribune vainly\ncounsels, and let Rates, Botts, or Bell, be the\nnominee, the stigma of abolition attached to\nthe ticket would drive every Pro-Slavery man\nin the South into the ranks of the Slave Democracy,\nand thus alienate every Southern\nState, while the taint of Pro-Slavery would disgust\nand drive off every Anti-Slavery man in\nthe Free States, thereby restoring the Democracy\nin them to power. On the other hand, let\nChase, Seward, or Banks, be the candidate, and\npass what resolutions you please, ignore, evade,\nor mystify real issues as you may, does any\nman in his senses believe that a single Southern\nState could be carried? And does not\nevery man in his senses see that a policy so\ndisingenuous would inevitably hazard the success\nof the ticket in the Free States?\nLet us be honest, manly, consistent.\nWe shall be pleased to have the co-operation\nof the Conservatives and Old Wbigs, whom the\nTribune is so concerned for, but if, when the\nlines are drawn between a Slavery-Propagating\nDemocracy and a Slavery-Restricting Republican\nParty, they prefer the success of the former,\nthen we know they would be satisfied with\nnothing short of the total surrender of Republican\nPrinciples, the disorganization of the Republican\nParty, and the adoption of the same\npolicy in relation to Slavery, that has given it\nits present mastery in the country. If, 011 the\ncontrary, they are sincere in their desire to see\nthe Black Democracy overthrown, let them\nunite with the only Party, whose moral power\nand numerical force are sufficient for the\nachievement of that end ; and let the Tribune\nreconsider its ground, and ponder well the\nquestion, whether its counsels are not calculated\nto raise expectations among Conservatives\nand Old Whigs that must come to naught, and\nto sow dissension and distrust among Republicans,\nunfavorable to united and decided action.\nTHE WAR PROSPECT IN EUROPE.\nThe long-promised Ministerial statements of\nthe progress and actual state of negotiations\nupon the Italian question were made in the\nBritish House of Lords by the Earls of Malmesbury\nand Derby, and in the House of Commons\nby Mr. Disraeli, on the 18th ult.\n\" From these revelations, it appears that the\ninformal intermediation attempted by the English\nGovernment, through the visits of Lord\nCowley to Paris and Vienna, had reached an\nencouraging stage when the proposition of a\ngeneral Congress, emanating from Russia, was\nreceived. Abandoning its individual efforts,\nthe British Cabinet at once devoted itselt to advance\nthe Russian project, but early encountered\na serious difficulty in the refusal of Austria\nto treat unless Sardinia disarmed. Subsequently,\nthi3 difficulty was obviated bv a suggestion\nthat the three quasi belligerent Powers\nshould disarm previous to the meeting of the\nCongress. Austria acceded to this plan, but\nSardinia declined, and the Emperor of the\nFrench would only comply with an important\nmodification?namely, that if Sardinia disarmed,\nshe should be admitted to a seat in the\nCongress, and that the disarmament should not\nprecede the deliberations of the Congress, but\nshould constitute their initial topic. As there\nwas no hope of Austria or England acquiescing\nin these requirements, the ultimate possibility\nof a pacific settlement seemed, at the departure\nof the steamer, to have entirely vanished. Indeed,\nin all well-informed circles, it was understood\nthat the object of the counter proposition\nof France was merely to gain time for the completion\nof her military preparations.''\nThe Earl of Derby made an able speech, in\nthe course of which he said :\nu The time is nearly come when England?\nwhich has, indeed, made one more effort, suggested\none more proposition, which I am not\nat liberty to lay before your Lordships?shall\nsay that the period has gone by for trifling, and\nthat, having exhausted all her powers of persuasion,\nand left no stone unturned to effect a\nsettlement upon principles which have received\nthe unanimous approval of her Parliament, she\nmust, however reluctantly, withdraw from interference\nin affairs in which she can no longer\nhope her interference would be useful to the public\ninterests or consistent with her own dignity,\nand must again reserve to herself, as she has\ndone up to the present moment, absolute and\nentire freedom to take such steps as she may\nhereafter think fit. [Cheers.]\n\" My noble friend has already pointed out the\nlamentable consequences which must arise, If\nwar does break out, to Italy herself, whatever\nbe the ultimate result, or whoever be in the first\ninstance successful. I think my noble friend\nunderrates the magnitude of the danger, if he\nsupposes that the war will be confined to Italy.\nIt will be a war, in the first place, of the most\nsanguinary description, because a war of principle\nand of passion. It will not be a war between\ntwo great nations contending for some\ndefinite object, but a war exciting the most violent\npassions ; and once begun in Italy, it will\nextend far beyond the limits of that country.\nOther passions will be roused, other interests\nwill be touched, other nations will be called to\ninterfere, and the war originating in Italy will\ncertainly at no distant period extend far and\nwide, wrapping the whole of Europe in one\ngeneral conflagration.\"\nMr. Gladstone condemned in strong language\nthose passages of Mr. Disraeli's speech in which\nhe seemed to imply that if England took a part\nin the probable war, it would be on the side of\nAustria. The English people cannot be dragged\ninto the support of Austrian absolutism.\n5, 1859.\nTHE FOUR PRINCIPAL PHASES OF\n' DEMOCRACY.\"\nThe perpetual unrest of the \" Democracy \"\nin search of a platform, tirm and durable, if\nviewed from a picturesque point of view, has\nsomething in it truly touching.

The deluge has come upon them,\nbut no ark of safety presents itself, to give assurance\nthat even a remnant is to be saved.\nNo bow of hoDe sunns the heavens, in token of\ncoming rest and sunshine. Down, down, they\ngo, still wrangling and fighting for the spoils,\nand agreeing in nothing.\nFor many years, the sham Democracy, in\ncommon with their opponents, the Whigs, stood\nfirmly by the Missouri compromise. But in an\nevil hour, Mr. Douglas, of Illinois, instigated by\nthe demon of ambition, moved its repeal, that\nthe Territories now known as Kansas and Nebraska\nmight become slaveholding. In order\nto reconcile the Northern people to this measure,\nMr. Douglas laid it down as an indisputable\naxiom in politics, that the people of the\nTerritories have the same right to regulate their\ndomestic affairs that the people of the States\npossess, fie claimed for them absolute independence\nin the formation of their local laws\nand institutions, independent of the Federal\nGovernment. Said he, we concede to them by\nEneral consent the right to legislate upon the\nrelations u of parent and child, of guardian and\nward, of master and apprentice;\" then why not\nconcede the same right of legislation in regard\nto negroes? Are negroes so much better than\neverybody else, that their rights require the peculiar\nprotection of the Federal Government? This\ndemagoguism, shallow and heartless as it was,\nwas not without its weight, and the bulk of the\nNorthern Democracy followed their leaders in\npursuit of the phantoms, \" popular sovereignty \"\nand \" non-intervention.'' The Slavery propagandists\nof the South, thinking that the great\nobstacle to the admission of Slavery into the\nNorthwest Territories was removed, were in\necstacies, and shouted for joy. President Pierce\nhesitated, but at length was swept alontr in the\n\" Democratic \" current, the great majority of\nthe Southern Whigs grounded arms, and joiued\nthe chorus of non-intervention ; and all hands\nconcurred in proclaiming the final overthrow of\nAbolitionism.\nBut the people took the Federal Government\nat its word, and organized emigration companies\nfor the settlement of Kansas. The border\nruffians of Missouri, aided by the Central Government,\nattempted to beat the people back,\nand seize Kansas as a slaveholding possession*\nThey were foiled,\\ and the people triumphed.\nThe propagandists saw their error in admitting\nthe doctrine of\" popular sovereignty.\"' They repudiated\nthe dangerous heresy, and insisted\nthat neither Congress nor the Territorial Legislatures\ncan exclude Slavery. Upon this issue\nthey staked the Union, as usual. The Federal\nGovernment immediately adopted it, and, by its\niuiluence over the Supreme Court, a decision\nor opinion of the Court was promulgated,\nsimultaneously with the present President's inaugural\naddress, declaring this to be the true\ninterpretation of the Constitution.\nHprP. tliPli. HMP wnnltl Intro annnAco\/1 tlm\nDemocracy had found a resting place, a \" finality.\"\nBut not so. For, however congenial to\nSouthern minds the idea that neither Congress\nnor the people of a Territory can exclude Slavery,\nit was found to be utterly impossible to\nkeep the Northern allies to their allegiance\nupon such a basis. Its effect was to drive the\njrank and file into ^he Republican party. Mr.\nDouglas, notwithstanding his overweening confidence\nin himself, at length saw that this must\nbe the result, and hastened to make an issue\nwith his former friends, by opposing the policy\nof forcing Slavery into Kansas under the\nfraudulent Lecoinpton Constitution. Gradually,\nas his prospects.for the Senate became clouded\nover, he grew bolder, and at length uttered\nhis Freeport speech, in which, while acknowledging\nthe authority of the Dred Scott decision, ]\nhe insisted that practically the people of a Ter- i\nritory may exclude Slavery by \" unfriendly\nlegislation.\"\nThis was bold language for a man who has\never acknowleged his allegiance to the slave interest,\nand at one time it threatened to be his\nfinal undoing. But Mr. Douglas has done\nmuch to counterpoise the effect of this heretical\nutterance, by the alacrity with which he has\nsupported the President's thirty million corruption\nfund for the purchase of Cuba, his advocacy\nof the policy of taking military possession\nof Mexico and Central America, and the pains\ntaken by his organ in this city to show that, in\npoint of fact, popular sovereignty is an empty\nsound, signitying nounng.\nBut the South, led on by Henry A. Wise, of\nVirginia, took the alarm at the idea of \" unfriendly\nlegislation,\" and now goes a stride be\"\nyond anything heretofore demanded, by insisting\nthat Slavery must be protected in the Territories.\nThe Administration, hoping to find a happy\nmedium between these extremes, lays down,\nthrough its new organ, the Constitution, a third\nplatform, in the following words :\n\" There is 110 longer any intestine dissension\nof the least importance in the Democratic party\non the Slavery question. The principles emblazoned\non the banner are, non-intervention,\nby Congress or by Territorial Legislatures,\neither to establish or prohibit Slavery within the\nTerritories, and the protection of slave property\ntherein, as long as the Territorial condition\nshall remain, by the Judiciary, under the Constitution\nof the United Slates.\"\nThe Douglas organ, the States, takes fire at\nthis new platform of Mr. Buchanan, and denounces\nit as utterly fatal to Southern interests.\nW? confess that we felt curious, as we took up\nthe article of the States, to know where its\neditor would join issue with the Constitution.\nIn our simplicity, we imagined that the ramparts\nthrown around the institution of Slavery\nby the President's organ were sufficiently strong;\nbut the Douglas organ, with its habitual con\"\ncern for Slavery, detects a perilous gap in the\nwall, through which the Free-Soil hosts may\nmarch with flags flying and drums beating.\nTKo u'Pfil* nnint its nrpaont^tl 111 thp linlnrkv\n^ f J\nword \" establish.\" The idea that the people\nof the Territories cannot establish Slavery i? to\nthe Douglas organ mopstrous. That paper is\nclear on the point that they cannot prohibit\nSlavery, because such legislation would contravene\nthe Dred Scott decision ; and, in the name\nof all that is reasonable, what can popular sovereignty\nsignify, if it is not the right to establish\nand protect Slavery ? We confess that we cannot\nsee.\nBut there still remains another wing of the\nDemocracy to be noticed, which, by the common\nconsent of all the others, has been pronounced\nhopelessly heretical. We allude to the\nPennsylvania or Forney wing. The schismatics\nof Pennsylvania not only iusist upon\npopular sovereignty in the Territories in the\nbroadest sense of the term, and, if we mistake\nnot, nncontrolled by Supreme Court decisions,\nbut they avow themselves opposed to the admission\nof Slavery into the Territories. They\nalso denouqge the idea of reviving the slave\ntrade in unmeasured terms ; and, in general,\ntheir sentiments upon the subject of Slavery\nare more in conformity with those of the Re\n= ?\npublican party, than with the sham Democracy.\nHere, then, are four Democratic platforms,\nall claiming to be the true and regular one, and\neach differing front the other.\n1. There is the President's platform, as announced\nin his organ, the Conxfitution, which\ndeclares that neither Congress nor the Territorial\nLegislatures have any right to establish\nor prohibit Slavery. It is silent as to the re- ,\nvival of the African slave trade.\n2. The Wise or true Southern platform,\nwhich insists that it is the duty of Congress to\npass laws for the protection of Slavery in the\nTerritories, and to abolish the laws which prohibit\nand punish the African slave trade.\n3. The Douglas platform, which insists that ,\nthe Territorial Legislatures may adopt \" un- ,\nfriendly legislation \" against Slavery, but which\nhe at the same time admits to be unconstitu- ,\ntioual, and therefore void. His centra\/ organ\ninterprets the doctrine of Mr. Douglas to mean (\nthat the Territorial Legislatures may exercise ,\ntheir popular sovereignty by establishing and\nupholding Slavery; while any \" unfriendly ]\nlegislation \" will be treated as a nullity by the\nFederal courts. The same organ insists that ^\nthe South has a right to demand the repeal of ,\nthe laws against the slave trade.\n4. The Hiekman-Forney platform, which (\ninsists on popular sovereignty absolutely, and i\nfavors the exclusion of Slavery from the Territories.\nIt also insists on a rigid enforcement |\nof the laws which punish the slave trade as 1 :\npiracy. I\nEach of these factions denounces all the i\nothers with extreme bitterness. The IlickmauForney\nfaction occupies the untenable position\nof affecting to claim Mr. Douglas as its leader, ,\nwhen, in fact, he has more sympathy with the t\nmost ultra Southern wing, represented by Wise\nDavis, and Brown, than w ith the Free-Soil schismatics\nof Pennsylvania. The latter cannot\nsupport Douglas without a flagrant apostacv j\nfrom the principles laid down at their recent\nState Convention, while the other three wings 1\nof the Democracy might with perfect consisten- ' '\ncy unite in support of the Illinois Senator.\nSince writing the above, we perceive, by the 1\nWashington correspondent of the New York\nHerald, that negotiations are on foot between\nthe different factions of the Democracy \" for j\na reunion on the basis of the President's plat- ]\nform as above given ; that is to say, entire ab- |\nstinence from Congressional and Territorial 1\nlegislation for or against Slavery, but with the '\nample protection iA the institution furnished by J\ntllP Spfitt flftpia'win ami tVw> fntiiro actinn\nof the court in accordance therewith. It is j\nsaid by the J It raid's correspondent that Mr. '\nDouglas has assented to this arrangement; but\nwhether Mr. Wise and the Southern ultras agree J\nto it. is not stated. We presume that thus far (\nthe arrangement only includes the Administration\nand Douglas. The writer says that Forney\nholds out against it, but that he will either have '\nto come in, or go over to the Republicans.\nThese diplomats, we predict, will still have\nserious work to perform, before they restore <\nharmony to the ranks. They may induce the <\nSouthern fire-easters to yield the point in regard\nto the protection of Slavery in the Territories\nby Congressional legislation, as that is at ]\nbest an impracticable humbug; but what will\nthey do with the slave trade ? Will they agree\nto let the laws against it sleep ? We intend 1\nstrictly to observe the tone of the allied organs\nof the Black Democracy in this respect. The as- 1\nsurance has been given by Douglas, that he will\nnot sustain the people of the Territories in enacting\n\" unfriendly legislation \" against Slavery:\nwhile the Administration pledges Federal sup- ;\nport, including that of the Supreme Court, to i\nthe institution ; and we shall not be surprised\nif private assurances are given that no serious i\netforts will ha made enforce the laws for the !\nsuppression of the slave trade.\nSuch nre the known and probable terms of\ncoalition between the corrupt and spoils-seeking 1\nfactions of the Slave Democracy. It would be j\ndifficult to imagine a basis of union more thoroughly\nPro-Slavery. Conscious that the majority\nof the people who are likely to occupv the\nTerritories in future will be aversa to Slavery,\nthis platform proposes to strip them entirely of\ni i f i . rti I\nlegislative Junctions in regard to Slavery, that ;\nsubject being entirely too high fur popular sovereigns\nto dispose of. If tliis statement of the\nHerald turns out to be correct, it will finally\ndispose of Mr. Douglas's popular-sovereignty\nhobby; or, at any, rate, deprive him of the ben- (\nefit of it. He will simply drop down to the level\nof other Northern instruments of the Slave '\nPower, and be as impotent for evil as he is dis- '\ninclined to good.\nMR. FRENCH'S REMARKS AT THE JEF- |\nPERSON BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION. ]\nAfter a fine piece of music from the band,\nMr. Blair introduced Major Benjamin B. French '\nas the person selected to read the Declaration 1\nof Independence. '\nMr. French prefaced the reading of that (\ncherished paper with the following remarks :\nMy Friends and Fellow Citizens :\nAbout eighty-three years ago, the hand of j\nthe man the anniversary of whose birth we ,\nmeet here this evening to celebrate, was engaged\nin writing one of the most remarkable\npapers which ever emanated from mortal brain. 1\nIt was the great charter of our Liberties?our <\nDeclaration of Independence ! ;\nOn the fourth of July, 177?i, that glorious\nDeclaration was unanimously adopted by the 1\nCongress of the United Colonies, and this Na- 8\ntion assumed its rank among the Nations of \"J\nthe earth as \" the United States of America.\" r\nOn that day, or immediately subsequent (\nthereto, that Declaration received the signatures\nof fifty-six men?brave, determined, resolute? v\nmen who had declared their rights, and. at all 1\nhazards, were determined to maintain them? r\nmen whom we may well be proud to call our j\npolitical fathers, and whose like we ne'er shall ^\ni... .1: nrvrrn otroin \" j\nThat Declaration emanated from the hrain c\nand came from the pen of Thomas Jefferson, v\nwell and truly designated as *'the great Apostle <j\nof Liberty,\" whose republican principles we t\nadopt, whose memory we revere, and the anniversary\nof whose birth we have met here to commemorate.\nN\nMost appropriate and most proper, then, it is\nthat we should listen to that Declaration ; and\nthe welcome doty of reading it has been as- (\nsigned to me, which I shall now proceed to perform.\ni\nMr. French then, iu a clear and audible voice, (\nand with much emphasis, read the Declaration\nof Independence. (Mr. French's remarks and ,\nthe reading were received with applause.)\nA Fiexp ix Human Shapk.?The master ;\nol a vessel from iiath, Maine, has been arretted\nat San h ranciseo, in consequence of the inhu- t\nman treatment of his crew. Two men were 1\nfound on board, whose condition is in the last '\ndegree wretched. The Bulletin says:\n\" The (logging was of the most brutal description\npossible to conceive ; for the naked backs\nand sides of the men were not only completely t\ncut up with lashes, but salt brine was thrown b\nupon the wounds, and allowed to dry on ; and (\nthis operation was repeated a number of times, j\nTo add to the horror, the men were ironed to\nthe floor of the hold, and barely sufficient food *given\nthem to support the almost extinct spark fi\nof life.

The sham Democracy, for the sah.- .if\nkeeping or making terms with the anti-Leeoinu\nton Northern u Democracy,\" has ventured to\ntake the position that Congress should not interveue\nto prevent the Territories from excluding\nSlavery by \" unfriendly legislation.\" This\nposition falls short in liberality of that heretofore\noccupied bv the \"Americans\" and Whi^.\nBut the latter, with unparalleled prostitution,\nhave seized the opportunity to outbid the I).\nmocracy for the support of the slave interest.\nThe American or Whig candidate. Bell, take,\nthe ground that it is the duty of i t()\nprotect Slavery in the Territori.-.; and the\nLouisville Journal, the old organ of 11. nn\nPlav. and defender of his A nti\njion views, comes up squarely and eiitliusia-ti\nally to the support of this ultra Southern d?'11\nand.\nFrom the report of ? debate between Me<*rs.\nBell and Magotfiu, the candidates of the Whig-,\nind Democrats for the Governorship, which to< k\nplace at Lebanon, Ky., we quote as follows froru\n:he Louisville Journal:\n\" As for myself. said Mr. Bell, 1 have no concealments\nto make. By virtue of the Constitu:ion\nof the United States. Slavery goes into the\nTerritories as soon as a Territorial Government\ns organized : and as soon as it is organized, the\nConstitution tlings its protecting wing arour.d\nt. The power of Congress under the Coustitnion\nis ample to protect and not to impair any\night. Slave property stands on the same foot\nng as all ut^ier personal property, and, as :i\nNorthern man has a right to be protected in\niny species of property, so a Southern man has\ninder the Constitution the fullest guarantee fur\nhe full protection of his slave property in the\nTerritories. He then would ask Mr. Magotlin\n1st. Has Congress the constitutional power\n;o protect Slavery in the Territories?\n2d. Ought Congress to interfere to protect\nsouthern property in slaves in the Territorh '\nMr. Bell answered both these questions fully\nind fairly in the aflirmativa, and asserted that\nt was the bounden duty of Congress to protect\ntot only against any actual prohibition hut\nurainst any ' unfriendlv legislation ' on rt... ......\njf a Territorial Legislature.'\"\nThe same report continues:\n\"Mr. Magoffin, in his halt-hour replv, t. 1.\nlie ground that Congress has the power to pa--,\nlaws to protect Slavery in the Territories but\nit\" the Territorial Legislature refuse to pas- pr\ntective laws or legislate unfriendly to Slav.rv,\nlie was 011 the ground, broad and square,.,!\nCongressional non-intervention. We had the\nSupreme Court of the I'nited States to ij t .-al\n:o, and that was the last resort.\"\nThe Louisville Journal referring to this d.!>ate\nin a leading editorial, says:\n\" Makoffix in' Favor of Svuattfr Sovkreiontt?The\nIssue Fairi.v Made l*r.?It will\nt>e seen from the fejrort in our paper to-dav of\n;he discussion at Lebanon 011 Tuesday, that the\nDemocratic candidate for the Governor.-hip 111\nKentucky has declared unquivocallv in favui\nof squatter sovereignty, whilst the gifted and\nirlorious standard-bearer of the Opposition has\ndeclared as unequivocally against it.\n\" This settles the issue ; it defines the position\nof the Democracy of Kentucky on the point in\nquestion beyond the reach of the protest of disenters\nor the subtlety of trimmers. It lix< the\nthing. It nails the party fast and firm to\nthe most odious and indefensible dogma that\nhas ever disfigured the politics of the country.\nHere and there, undoubtedly, a member of the\nDemocracy will twist and squirm : but the 1ki.Iv\nof the party, the party itself, is pinned iuiniov\nably to the hideous and noxious doctrine. The\nDemocracy of Kentucky is at length not onlv\nvirtually but formally committed to the vi.e\nheresv of suuatter Koveroitrnt v Tim\nrepresentative, ihe authoritative exponent ot\nthe organization has publicly and explictly endorsed\nthe wretched juggle. DocglasisM, thi:\nMOST ACTIVE AMI FATAL SHAPE OF AboLITHIV\nISM, IS OPENLY TRIl'MI'UAXT IX THE i'oc.mtls\nOF THE PARTY.\"\nIn another articl. the Journal follows up the\nassault ?pon the \" Democracy \" and their candidate\nin the following fierce style:\n' Who does not turn with an exalting .sen-1\nof relief and a glow of pride from this rickety\nand slouching heresy, to the fair and nianlv\nand statesmanlike position of Joshua F. Bell 1\nRejecting with ineffable scorn, as every candid\nman of ordinary sense must do, the Slat sman'j\ncherished fallacy that the power to protect implies\n\"the power to destroy, Mr. Bell assert-,\nfrankly, at once the power and the duty of Cousrress\nto protect (if necessary) the right- of the\nSouth in the Territories of the Union. 'On ?\nthe new question of protection to Slavery in\nthe Territories,\" says the Democratic authority\nfrom which we have already quoted, ' Mr. Ml\nassumed a bold and decided position. He was\nin favor of the protection of slave property by\nCongressional legislation, in the event of the\nTerritorial Legislature's failing to pass protective\nlaws.' How nobly does this position\ncontrast with the cowardly and faithless dodge\njf non-intervention, as now interpreted by the\nDemocracy of the State, whether resting on\ndenial of the power of Congress to intervene, or\nan the alleged impolicy of exerting the power!\nIt is as light com oared with darkness.\"\nWe confess our surprise at finding Mr. Cr;'\nenden ardently engaged in supporting this\nlltra Pro Slavery sectional ticket. From the\neditorial columns of the Journal we again\njuote as follows :\n\" Hon. John J. Crittenden was present at an\nOpposition meeting in Franklin county last\nweek, which appointed Congressional conferees,\nand addressed those assembled in an\niarnest, forcible, and eloquent speech.\"\nThe idea of a co-operation between honest\nRepublicans and such an 44 opposition \" as that\n)f Kentucky, is utterly preposterous. No genu\nne Republican can have any sympathy with a\nlespieable spoils-seeking faction, which ha*\nibased itself in the dust before the slave power.\nThis same Kentucky 4* opposition \" has, until\necently, made a great merit of its oppo-oti\"\"\no the repeal of the Missouri Compromise, by\nvhich Slavery was excluded from the greater\n>art of our Western Territories. And now,\nnerely for the sake of success, it avows itselt\n11 favor of legislating Slavery into those Terri\nories. Henry Clay said that no human power\nould induce him to vote for the spread of Sla\ncry over a foot of free soil ; and here are his\nlegenerate followers in Kentucky, proclaiming\nheir readiness to legislate the institution into\nill the Territories of the Union, however re\nrolting it may be to the inhabitants.\nXox-I.VTKRVEVTioy.?Thoce who are ready\no support the pretensions of Presidential a\nlirants who profess to be in favor of non-inter\nrention on the part of Congress with Slavery in\nhe Territories, would do well to scan closely\nvhat is meant by the term. Senator Green, of\nMissouri, for instance, professes to be a non-iu\nerventionist. He said:\n\" The doctrine of non-interference by Con\nTress with Slavery in the Territories means,\nmd can only mean, that Congress should nei\nher establish nor prohibit it. That is u'l.\nLeave these questions to the Constitution and\no the courts. But whatever rights individuals\nlave in the Territory, may demand, and when\nlemanded, mi st have adequate protection.\"\nSenator Green but fore-shadows the interpreation\nwhich would be placed upon the doctrine\niy many of those who are loudest in its praise,\n\"ofcgress is not to legislate Slavery into the\nterritories. O nol that is unnecessary. The\nConstitution carries the institution into every\nx>t of the public domain, and the rights of inlividuals\nthus established by virtue of the Contitutiou\nmay need protection. If needed.

Tho histo\nry of Congressional prohibition utterly\nemohsbed tho argument wo claim mat\nthe prohibition of Slavery by Congress is\nuot only unconstitutional and contrary to\nthe principles upon which tho' govern\nment wits founded, but .thai, it. ever has\nbeen ignored by the pcoplo of the Terri\ntories in every inslanco where it has been\napplied, nnd that it has no influonco in\nexcludiug slavery therefrom.\nIs ow for tho tacts :\nTho ordinance known as Jefferson's\nOrdinance, was passed uuder tho old Con\nfederacy, and before tho present Consti\ntution of tho Uuitcd estates was adopted.\nIt extended over tho North-West Jerri-\ntory, now comprising tho btatcs of Uhio,\nIndiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin\nand Iowa. Tho ordinance declared that\nthere shall neither be slavery nor invol\nuntary servitude in tho said .territory,\notherwiso than in punishmeut of ciimo,\"\ntc. Wo now appeal to tho statistics\nfound in tho compendium of tho census\nof tho United States for 1850, page 82,\nto ascertain what effect this prohibition\nhad upon slavery in tho different portions\nof the North-West Territory. From tho\nfollowing table it will bo seen that in ev\nery portion of this vast Territory, African\nslavery was introduced bv tho people, and\nthe number of slaves held 111 thoditlerent\nportions of this Territory from 1810 to\n840:\n1810 1820 1830\n1840\n331\n3\n16\nIn Illinois,\nIn Indiana,\n168 017 754\n237\n100\nIn Iowa,\nIn Michigan, 24 32\nIn Ohio, 6\nIn Wisconsin,\n3\n11\nThus it is seen that tho settlers in all\nthese Territories disregarded thcordiunncc\nand in Illinois and Indiana slaves were\nheld bv hundreds.

Tho people controlled tho\nquestion in every respect, as they ever\nhave, in this country, and ever will, Jet\ntho law of Congress bo what it may.\nAlthough Illinois wns a part ot this\nNorth-West Territory, yet il wns admit\nted as a Stato in 1818, with a constitu\ntion recognizing slavery, nnd it wns uot\nfinally aWished until 1847, or twenty-\nnino years after her admission.\nIn November, 1802, ti Territorial Con\nvention was held at Vincenncs, composed\nof delegates from every part of Indiana\nTerritory, then comprising also what is\nnow tho Slate of Illinois. Gen. William\nIlenrv Harrison, alias \" Old Tippecanoe,\"\npresided over the convenliou.and a memo\nrial to Congress was prepared and passed\nun'nnimously, and signed by General Har\nrison as President of the convention.\nThis memorial petitioned Congress to re\npeal 1110 clause in 1110 oruinanco promot\ning slavery. This memorial was referred\nto ft commiltco who reported against\ngrunting the prayer of the petitioners, but\ntjongrcss uiu not tako any lurincr nciion\nupon it for some unknowu cause; prob\nably for want of lime, as tho committee\nreported the day previous to tho linal closo\nof that Congress.\nThe subject was considered by tho next\nCongress and several committees were ap\npointed to consider tho memorial nnd re\nport thereon, and thoy all reiortcd in fa\nvor of qranting the prayer of tho petition\ners. Hut Congress still neglected tg act\nupon it, until tho pcoplo of tho territory\ntired of delay, took tho law into their own\nhands, and tho Icrntorial Legislature ety\nacted a stringent 6lavo codo for tho Tcrri\nlory, and established slavery therein by\nlaw, 111 defiance of tho ordinance.\nId Illinois ft very slight slave codo was\ncnacled by tho people nnd enforced during\ntho existence of the Territorial government\nand re-enacted ajter it became a otatc,\nand continued in forco until 1847, when\nit was repealed.\nSlavery was finally abolished by tho\nsamo pcoplo and their children, becauso\nthey beenmo satisfied by experience that\nslavo labor was unprofitable. And yet\ntho modern black republicans persist in\nrlniminrr lioforA tlifl twinln tlmt tlio States\nof tho North-West aro now freo becauso\nslavery was l ept out by the ordinance of\n1787. Such an assertion only shows tho\nignorance of thoso who assert it. It may\nbo said that in mosfc of tho Territories\ncarved out of tho North-West Territory,\nsuch as Iowa, Wisconsin, Ohio and Mich'\nignD, but few slaves wcro introduced, and\nthat the prohibition of slavery in 'the or-\ndinanco of 1787 produced this result.\nBut such is. not the fact. Tho climate of\nthese Territories is .wholly unfit for slave\nlabor, ' and slavery never could have been\npermanently established, because tho pco\nplo found it unprofitable. Wo have no\ndesire or intention to defend slavery ns ft\ndomestic institution in any respect ' It is\nundoubtedly a curso to tho slave holder,\na curse to tho soil, and ft wrong perpetu\nated upon tho rights of the slave. Wo\nonly wish to show that, right or wrong, it\ncannot bo controlled by.

Congress never\nattempted to prohibit, tho sale of liquor\nin a AtTniory, or promoii gamuung.\nWhy then should it attempt to prohibit\nor establish slavery, while it leaves ALL\nO Illicit domestic nnd local matters to bo\nsettled by tho people\nPopular Sovereignty in Oregon.\nIt is claimed by tho republicans that\nOregon is now a free State becauso in '48\nCongress in organizing a Territorial gov\nernment for that Territory, prohibited\nslavery therein. Tho history of Oregon\nvhows that this prctenco is without any\nfoundation in fact, and nlso proves that\nPopular Sovorcignty is ngainst tho spread\nof Slavery. .\nPrevious to 1848 tho inhabitants of\nOregon had lived under a provincial gov\nernment formed by themselves. Cou\ngross had neglected to ennct a Territorial\neroverument, and truo to tho instincts of\ntho American people, tho settlers of that\nfar off land organized a govern men t,clect\ncd officers, and enacted laws, among tho\nfirst of which was one prohibiting slavery\nin tho Territory, nnd passed by a unani\nmous voto. This law:had been in force\nseveral years beforo .slavery was prohibit\ned by net of Congress. 1 lenco Congress\nonly ratified what tho pcoplo had dono\nyears beforo. This law prohibiting slave\nry was enacted at an early, day in the\nsettlement of tho Territory, and coming\nfresh from the people, secured Oregon to\nfreedom for all limo tocon:c.\nThe effect of ropxthrSovtrcignty in the\nTcrrxtgxies.\nPrevious to th admission of Cnlifor-\nprovincial government under which they\n. , .... n f\nlived for several year3. Mien a Consti-\n. J. , , ., . .\ntution was formed, slavery was prohibited\nby a unanimous \"volo of tho convention,\nand it was admitted a freo State. We\nhave already shown that Oregon was al\nso made ft freo Territory by local law,\nwithout tho aid of Congress. When\nCongress passed a Territorial government\nfor tho lernlory of lown, tho act per\nmilted tho people to do as they pleased\nunder tho Territorial government, in re-\ncard to slavery and otjicr local questions\nTho people prohibited slavery and Iowa\nis now a free btato. Congress, in lorm\ning a Territorial government for Wash\nington Territory, left the subject of slave\nry to tho people therein, and that lern\nlory is now free. In 1850 Congress or\nganized Iho Territories ot Utah and New\nMexico, leaving tho subject of slavery to\nbo controlled bv the people. While Utah\nis still free from slavery bv tho choico o\nIho people, tho Tcrrilorial Legislature of\nNew Mexico has passed a law protecting\nslavery. This is tho only 1 erritory where\ntho principle of Popular Sovereignty has\nbeen applied, that tolerates slavery ; nnd\ntho llepublicnns make a great noiso over\ntho fact that tho pcoplo in this instance\ntolerated slavery. JJut New Mexico\nprincipally settled by Southern emigrants\nwho would undoubtedly estauiisiied slave\ny if Congress had prohibited it, as was\n.ho caso in tho North-West Territory un\nlcr tho ordinaneo of 1787. Put vhcn\nemigration from tho North begins to bo\nuiniiuu iu milt murj , lb euivijr\nwill, tho subject will bo reviewed and h\nnally settled. If tho people decide in fa\nvor of slavery, it is their burden and not\nours, nor tho business of Congress\nIn 1854 Territorial governments for the\nTerritories of Kansas and Nebraska wcro\npassed by Congress, and through tho la\nbors nnd influenco of Mr. Douglas, the\npeople were left free to regulate their local\nand domestic institutions in their own\nway, slavery included.\nTho people of both thoso Territories\nhavo spoken, nnd declared against tolera\nting slavery. Thus it will bo seen that\nin all tho Territories in which tho pcopl\nhavo been left untrammcled nnd free from\nany interference of Congress,slavcry is ci\nther directly prohibited by local law, or\nkept out of tho 1 erritory by public scnti\nment, except in Nctt Mexico, which is as\nlikely to decide hereafter for freedom, as\nany \" other Territory, w hen it shall bo\nsettled bv Northern emigration, ns it will\nbo nt no distant day.\nThe Position of Parties.\nIn tho preceding articles we havo men\nlioned all tho Territories iu which Con\ngross ovor presumed to prohibit 6lavery\nNo act of prohibition was passed by Con\ngross for 30 years after tho adoption of\ntho Constitution, but tho subject of slavc-1\nry as well as oilier local and domestic in\nstitutions was left to 'bo decided by the\npeople. Iho Territories organized with\nin this fcriod comprised what aro now\nnown as tho bouth-Woslern States nnd\nslavery was extonded over them by law\nat th limo of tho adoption of tho Con-\nrri. irr 1 r\nBUkuuou. .Missouri jompromiso was\nrassed in 1820, and that part of it pro\nhibiting SlaVcry was repealed in 1854.\nWe havo shown that beforo its rcpenl,\nslavery began to bo introduced . into the\nTerritory over which it extended, and it\nis ft well known fact, that sinco its repeal,\nslavery has been .excluded from the greftt\ner bharc of tho samo Territory, nnd Kan\nsas is now asking admission into Union\nas a frco'S'ftlo.\nWo leav5 It with iho reader lo answer\nfor himself, after examining tho history\nol this subject, whether ho believes that\nthe prohibition of slavery by Congress\nwithout consulting tho wishes of tho peo-\nile, as advocated by the republican party,\n:ias had any beneficial effect in preventing\ntho spread of slavery. Iho Democratic\nparty wilh Douglas ns its leader, claim\nthat such prohibitory laws passed by Con\ngress, not warranted by tho Constitution,\nand in effect are a nitltity, and not worth\ntho cost nnd labor of enacting them.\nWhen tho people want slavery they will\nestablish it, when they do not want it\nthev will prohibit it. and if they ever be\ncome tired of it or find it unprofitable and\ndetrimental lo Iheir interests, thev will\npass laws to rid themselves of it: nnd\nthus control tho subject as fullv n3 all\nother lx-al concerns. And in this coun\ntry, and under our Constitution, thero is\nno power to prevent it, and there is no\nreason why thero should bo.

Tho\nauthor of the bill by which that act was\naccomplished, has from tho day of its in\ntroduction to Iho present time, been the\nrecipient of tho foulest abuse, lias been\nheld up to tho public gnzo as a traitor to\niho cause of freedom, nnd prayers have\nbeen offered up imploring family bereave\nments ns a mark of divine pleasuro with\nthis public career.

An opportunity, eager\nly seized, presented itself upon the appli\ncation of Missouri for nn enabling act,\n(ireparalory lo admission into the Union,\nvnowing that tho people of tho now\nState, as they had ft right under iho con\nstitution, as well as tho treafy with\nFrance, would ask adpiission with a con\nstitution favorable lo slavery, they .deter\nmined to opposo its admission on that\nground, hoping to crcato ft sectional ex\ncitement lo result in n division of tho\nNorthern Democracy, and their own ro\nlurn to an nscendnncy in the national gov\nernment. Mr. Jefferson characterized tho\nattempt nt the time, ns tho dying strug\nglo of eclipsed Federalism. Tho attempt\nto impose ft restriction of that kind, upon\nn State nsking for admission as a co-equal\namong Sovereign Stales, was so unheard\nof nnd extraordinary, as to crcnto Iho\nmost intense excitomont, and to arouso in\ntho minds of tho purest patriots, tho most\nserious apprehensions for tho fato of the\nRepublic. Many, in tho langungo of Mr.\nJellersou, regarded it as the death knell\nof tho Union. Tho rcstrielionisU wcro\ndefeated in their attempt upon Missouri,\ntho excitement was calmed, nnd tho con\ntroversy ended, by the nnssngo of nn net\nagreeing to ndrait Missouri without res\ntriction, nnd prohibiting slavery in tho re\nmainder of tho Territory of Louisiana\nnorth of 30 deg. 30 min. This lino, ex\ntending to our western boundary, divid\ning tho Territory fairly between the North\nand South was regarded as ft finnl settle\nment of the question of slavery to bo re\ngarded in nil future limo. '\nAll 13 J'lUlLIJ'IU Ul UIM1I\"IJ nuo M\"u-\nishment of geographical lino between the\ndifferent sections of tho Republic, was,\nhowever, regarded as a fatal step by the\nfathers of tho country, then living.

Tins could not bo effect cd with\nout a violation of that sacred compact,\nyet in the face of that net, Congress made\nthat addition.\nDuring tho samo year Arknnsn.s, form\ned out of the Territory ncquired of France\nnnd where slavery was allowed to go by\ntho compromise of 1820, asked lo be ad\nmitted into tho Union. Northern men,\nin violation of that compromise, opposed\nher admission because of her slavery con\nstitution, nnd when nccused of unfaithful\nness in that line, they boldly answered\nthat they did not regard its obligations.\nAgnin in 1854, when it wns proposed to\ninsert in tho resolution for the admission\nof Texas, a clauso extending tho liuo of\n30 degrees and thirty minutes through\nthat Territory, and prohibiting slavery\nnorth of said line, wo find eighty-two\nvotes recorded ngainst tho proposition iv.\ntho llouso of Reprcsentnlivcs, from tho\nnorth, ntnong which nro Hamlin, Hale,\nCollamcr nnd Giddings, all of them shin\ning lights in the temple of black republi\ncanism; men who daily imploro high\nheaven to avenge tho rejal of lhat sa\ncred compact.

A southern\nmember of Iho commiltco proposed to\nextend tho Missouri Compiomiso lino to\ntho Pncific, forever excluding slavery from\nono million six hundred thousand square\nmiles of Territory north of that line,\nwhilo in the Territory south of lhat line,\namounting to only two hundred nnd sev\nenty thousand squaro miles, tho people\nwcro to bo left to dispose of the question\nas they saw fit.

Ouo of'lhoso measures\nwas an agreement to leave tho Territories\nof Utah and New 'Mexico, tho exclusive '\nright to regulate tho question of slavery\nfor themselves. Tho whig and democttio\nparlies regarded thoso measures as a\n.\"settlement, in principle nnd sultstanco,\nof tho questions involved.\" and pledged .\nthemselves to carry them out in good faith\nand in the election of 1852 they wcro\ntriumphantly sustained.\nIn 1853 a bill for tho organization of\nWashington Territory, passed Congress.\nPeing the first enactment after tho coni\npromiso measures of 1850, wo most uatu\nraly refer to it ns nn exposition of tho\ndoctrine embodied therein.

Dec. 9th. '60,\nby tbe Rev. IIknrt J. Van Dyke, pnstnr of tlio\nFirst Presbyterian Church in Brooklyn, on\nhThe Character and Influence of Abolitionism.\"\nranks highest, and is regarded hy those of the\nsame faith as a masterpiece on the subject ;\nhence has been Heralded and Expressed through\nthe nation as a sort of finality.\nI readily concede to tbe author of this pro\nduction, three things :\nFirst. A pleasing popular style, well suited\nto a fashionable audience a style of sermoniz\ning, wherein rhetoric greatly predominates over\nlogic, and brilliant words and fine sentences over\nprofound thought and sound criticism.\nSkcond. I concede an apparent sincerity,\nwhich always adds weight and influence to any\nthing, even plausible in theory.\nThird. I concede an uneqnivocal outspoken\nadvocacy of Slavery, so palpable and obvions\nthat the author will never require a Southern\npass, or Northern endorser in traveling South,\nand residing where the system prevails in its\nworst forms.\nBut, as to origioality of conception, or a\ncritical investigation of the meaning and use of\nlanguoge, or definition of original words and\nterms involved in this controversy, I can discov\ner nothing of such merit in this production, af\nter the most diligent search. Its argumen's,\nand its Scriptural quotations, are the most com\nmon place, a new edition of old works on the\nsame subject, dressed in the author's own plau\nBible style, and well adapted to muke an im\npression at such a time as the present on a N.\nYork, or Brooklyn audience 1\nWhy did not Mr. Van Dyke condescend to\ninform us, definitely, what he means by the term\nSlavery, since he condemns all as such dunjier\noub characters, who believe slave-holdinif to he\nsinful T Does he mean to teach that Hebrew\nServitude, Roman and American slavery, and\nall other like, systems are one and the same\nthing T Why not inform us whether Bondman,\nServant, and Slave all mean tbe same thing 7 or\nif tbey differ, why not give us a few illustrations\nor examples of tbe use of these words, in their\noriginal application ? Why not explain the\nmeaning of \"buy,\" \"bought with money,\" \"bis\nmoney,\" fcc, when such phraseologies are em\nployed by the Jews to express certain relations t\nCertainly, a respectful deference to the opinions\nof multitudes of the most leurued an pious\nmen the world has ever known, and the deci\nsions of almost every ecclesiastical order in ex\nistence, including tile General Assembly of the\nPresbyterian Church of tbe United States,\nshould have led the author ol ibis sermon a-\ngainst \"Abolitionism,\" professedly, to fortify well\nevery position in defense of Slavery, a system\nof such doubtful origin and suspicious morals,\nand so repugnant to the spirit and genius of our\nnation, as a republican country.\nWith all deference to the author's talent, if\nthis sermon is a specimen of Mr. Van Dyke's\nusual manner of conducting controversy, his\nhabits are altogether too loose to render his con\nclusions safe or reliable, lie takes too much\nfor granted, where be knows men differ, and\nwhere proof is demanded. He speaks of Mas\nters as Slaveholders, of Servants as Slaves, of\n\"buying\" servants, as if they were passive brutes\ntransferred by an owner, and of servants being\ntbe \"money, and 'possessions\" of masters, in the\nsense of cash and real estate ; whereas Mr. Van\nDyke must know, as a \"scholar,\" that neither in\nHebrew, Greek, or English, do these words bare\ntucb a restricted meaning. Indeed, I deny iPOBt\nunequivocally, that the Hebrew code has any\nsuch words as \"Slave\" and \"Slaveholder\" in the\nAmerican sense. This should bave beea a la\nbored point In Mr. Van Dyke's position, if be\nintended to furnish Divine authority for slavery.\nHe shoald bave clearly set forth the chattel\ndoctrine, as defined and explained by the Amer\nican code, and then gone back to Patriarchal\ndays and the Mosaic code, and from tbe use of\nHebrew terms shown the Jewish and American\nsystems to be the same. To infer the Divine\norigin of American, or any other slavery, from\nJewish servitude, as it was tolerated under tbe\nMosaio dispensation, is about as sensible as to\nInfer the truth of Mormoniim from tbe existence\nof polygamy among the Jews. Even should\nwe admit, for the sake of argument, that Jewish\nservitude constituted a form of slavery, we\nmight supnose, on comparison with American\nslavery, nS tana would Infer from this fact the\nequity of the American system. But in regard\nto slavery, our opponent seem to argue on tbe\nprlnciple-ao Institution, one right, ia always\nright J neither time, oor change, nor any degree\nof apostacy can so vilWtt it, but wbat tbere re\nmains ao inherent righteousness, which eutitles\nit to vindication and Justification. Like the\nPope of Roue, it bos tu immutable! ever-eu-\ndoring succession, a divinely chartered existence\nto the end or time, aud however corrupt, it can\nnever be wrong.\nThe inference has been drawn a thousand\ntimes \"The Jews held servants by Divine per\nmission ( therefore, American slavery is right.\"\nI propose to test this logic, by the means usual\nly accorded in controversy.\nThe Rev. Mr. Van Dyke proposes to discuss\nthe character and ii.flueuce of Abolitiouisra.\nIlia text may be found\nI Tim. ti ! 1 S. !et aa many aervanta aa are under the\nyoke, connt their own M.vters worthy of all honor, that the\nname of llod and hia doctrine he not blasphemed. And they\nthat have believing Maatera, let them not deaplae them beoauae\nthey are brethren i but, fto.\nAfter announcing his text, five pages are de\nvoted to proving, thnt these servants were slaves;\nthat they bad believing Masters ; and in defin\ning the word \"Abolitionism,\" and stating his po\nsition. How much the question, whether these\nservauts under the yoke were slaves in the mod\nern sense, and whether their masters were true\nbelievers, bns to do with the real issue, will be\nan after consideration. As to his definition of\n\"Motitionism that an \"AbolUonist is one who\nbelieves that slaveholding is sin, and onght\ntherefore to be abolished ;\" I confess it look a\nlittle K!i8 calling everybody \"Block Repnblican\"\nthat don t vote with modern Democracy I Does\nnot Mr. Van Dyke know, that many who are\nconscientiously opposed to slaveholding as a\nsystem, and believe it sinful, still maintain that\nmen may innocently sustain the legal relation,\nwheu benevolence and tbe good of the slavo re-\n3uire It. Bnt we accept the definition, since it\nraws the line of demurkation sufficiently plain\nbetween the mends and toes or impartial, uni\nversal freedom, and while we welcome to onr\nliberty-loving brotherhood men of every faith\nand creed and nation, we would also remind lite\nadvocates and defenders of slavery, thnt they\ntoo have a brotherhood, of allies, made, up of\nquite as great extremes from the modest, hnm-\nble Northern apologist, down to tbe heartless\nsoul-drivers who reign on Southern plantations,\nand piratical kidnappers, doomed to death by\ntbe laws or onr country, who furnish the raw\nmaterial from Africa for American Slavery.\nAfter defining \"Abolitionism,\" Mr. Van Dyke\nstates his positions, as follows :\n1. Abolitiouism bos no foundation in the\n8criptures.\n2. Its principles have been promulgated chief\nly by misrepresentation and abuse.\n3. It leads, in multitudes of cases, and by\nlogical process, to otter infidelity\n4. It is the chief cause of tbe strife and the\ndanger that threatens our country.\nMr. Van Dyke \"proposes to discuss the char\nacter and influence of 'Abolitionism,'\" and af\nter an introduction of five pages lays down his\nfour positions, as I have just stated them. He\nthen slates the First, viz : \"Abolitionism has no\nfoundation in the Scriptures,\" and enters at once\ninto an argument to prove that Hebrew servi\ntude was a system of Slavery, so that Abolition\nism is to be proven unscriplural, by proving\nslnvery scriptural. Now, in order to meet each\nposition of my Rev. opponent, I will adopt the\nfollowing course of reply :\n1. Slavery has no foundation in the Scriptures.\n2. Slavery has been promulgated, chiefly by\nmisiepresenlatioo and abuse.\n3. Slavery, in a multitude of cases, and by\nlogical process, leuds to utter infidelity.\n4. Slavery is the chief cause of the strife thnt\nagitates, and the danger that threatens our\ncountry.\nMy object in changing the terms, while I re\ntain the order, is to vindicate rational Aboli\ntionism by proving that Slavery is the criminal\ntried and condemned by reason and revelation.\nSlavery is an unscriplural system, promulgated\nchiefly by misrepresentation and abuse tondiiivr\nto infidelity, causing strife and endangering the\nsafety tnd welfure of onr country ; while aboli\ntionism is the very opposite of slavery, both in\nspirit and design, therefore tends to opposite\nresults.\nLet me not be misunderstood on this point.\nI take Abolitionism in the sense defined. \"An\nAbolitionist is one who believes Slaveh Ming is\na sin, therefore ought to be abolished.\" He may\nbe a Colonizationist, a gradual emancipationist,\na moral suationist, a legal suasionist. or acome\nonter. According to Mr. Van Dyke's definition,\nit is tbe faith that makes the man, anil not the\nmeasures. I do not charge Mr. Van Dyke with\nendorsing the African Slave Trade, because lie\nendorses Slavery. Nor can he charge me with\nendorsing extreme measures because. I endorse\nthe doctrine of Abolitionism, as laid down by\nhimself.\nAgain : Abolitionists believe thot slavehold\ning, as a system is sin, and ought therefore to\nbe abolished. Of course, then they do not be\nlieve that it originated with the pure God, is\napproved by Him, or is endorsed by the Reve\nlation He has given us. When, therefore, they\nhear old Abraham and other Patriarchs, and\nHebrew worthies denominated \"Slaveholders,\"\nthey regard it as profane and libelous I They\nbelieve that Hebrew servitude was a benevolent\nsystem,rre from all taint of \"chattelism,\" and\nno more like American slavery, than the gov\nernment of Austria is like tbe purest Repub\nlicanism, or Christianity like Paganism.\nBut the advocates of American slavery, driv\nen to the wall by the force of increasing light\nand the progress of public opinion, and know\ning too well the bare-faced corruption of the\nAmerican system, to dare risk the argument on\nits inherent merits, like a renegade, going\nout of towu to prove his character good, they\nare obliged to make a mission way back into\nthe twilight of tbe world's history, soon after\nthe flood, in search of testimony. And wbat\ndo they bring back as evidence t Why, Noah\ncursed Canaan, and said \"A servant of servants\nshalt thou be onto thy brethren;\" and a little\nlater in the world's history, good old Abraham\nowned servants, \"bought with his money,\" and\n\"born in his bouse;\" aud still a little latter, lie-\nbrew servitude wag recognized and regulated by\nlaw. This completes the chain of Old Testa\nment testimony But where is chattel slavery,\nin all this display of words t I boldly answer,\nJVo where ! It can't be found in tbe Old Tes\ntament code.\nLet me now bring Slavery to the bar and in\ntroduce the testimony of the Scriptures against\nit. My position aQirjis,\n1. Slavery bas no foundation iu the Scriptures.\nr iRBT wnai is slavery 7 Webster says,\n-uoouage : tne state or entire subjection of oae\nperson to tbe will of another. Slavery is the\nobligation to labor for the benefit of the mas\nter, without the contract or consent of tbe ser\nvant.\" . But let us look into the American slave code\nfor tbe law defiuiug the relations and condition\nof a slave :\n\"A Slave la on who la Id the power of a Muter, to whom\nha belonga. The mauler may aell turn, diapoee of hia peraoo,\nhia induatiy and bin labor, be oao do oatiiing, poweaa nothing,\nnor touuire anything, but what muat belong to bia MaaUr.\"\nLaw i or LouiauaA-\nThe laws of South Carolina say. \"Slaves\nshall be deemed sold, taken, reputed aud ad\njudged in luw to be chattels personal, in the\nhands of their owners and possessors, and their\nexecutors, administrators and assigns, to all iu\ntents constructions and purposes whatever.\"\nJudge Stroud says \"Tbe cardinal principle of\nslavery that the slave is not to be rauked a\nmong sentient being,, but among things is an\narticle of properly a chattel personal, abtaius\nas undoubted law in all these states.\"\nHence, it ta perfectly obvious, that the 'chat\nteC principle Is the lift's blood, of Americun\nSlavery. As a farther illustatioo of this fact,\nbear a statement from the lawg of Marylund.\n'In case the personal property of a ward shall\nconsist of specific articlus, such as slates, work\ning beasts, animal of any kind, stock , furniture,\nplate, books, and 10 forth, tbe court, if it shall\ndeem it advantageous for the ward may at any\ntimo pass an order for the sale thereof.'\nAccording to Blackstone, 'chattels personal,\nare things moveable, as animal, furniture of a\nhouse, jewels, corn, 4c.' Slaves, according to\nthe code of slavery, are 'chatties perionaL' Re\nducing men, therefore to slavery, is convertino\nthem Into property, as truly as cutching a wild\nhnrse is turning him Into property. He ean Aa\nnothing, acquire nothing, possess nothing. All\nright to himself is abrognted, and he may be\nbought and sold, and mortgaged and rented and\ntraded, the same as any other property.\nAnd yet, Mr. Van Dyke says 'Abolitionism\nis abusive in its persistent misrepresentation of\nthe legal principle involved in the relation be\ntween master and slave. Its teachers reiterate,\nin a thousand exciting forms, the assertion thnt\nthe idea of property in man blots out his man\nhood and degrades him to the level of a brute,\nor a stone.' Me then asks 'do not these Ano\nlitionist Philosophers know, that according to\nthe laws of every civilized country on earth, a\nman has properly in his children, and a woman\nhas property in her husband.' No, Mr. Van\nDyke, neither Abolition Philosophers, nor any\nother philosophers, unless they are Pro-slavery\nrhilosnjihers, know, or believe any such doctrine,\nas that fathers may have property in children,\nhusbands have property in wives, and wives\nhave procrty in husbands, in tbe true legal,\ntechnical sense of property.\nWith all deference to Mr. Van Dyke's legal\nknowledge. I confess a suspicion that this is a\ndodge, a mere evasion of the real point at\nissue. True, a father may have a right in his\nchildren, a husband may bave a right in his\nwife ; aud a wife may have a right in ber bus\nband ; but are children a father's 'chattel t and\ncan he advertise and sell them at public auc\ntion 1 Can husbands mortgage, or sell their\nwives, as slaveholders do their 'chattels person\nal' f Or can wives sell their hnshands whenev\ner a change is deemed desirable t If not, then\nthere is no parrellcl between 'property in child\nren and husbands,' and property in slaves.\nMr. Van Dyke, evidently sees, that the 'chat\ntel principle' applied to Hebrew servitude, will\nbe fatal to his Scriptural argument based on the\nOld Testament ; hence,- the effort to explain\nand soften down the doctrine of 'property in\nman,' so 03 to harmonize it with Hebrew servi\ntude, without impeaching the character of the\nBible. Hence, after a supposed case to prove\nthat a wife has property in her husband vie ;\nthe husband is killed on the Railroad and the\nwife collects damages as if damages paid for\nher loss he adds. 'Thus, the common law of\nChristendom, and the statutes of our own state,\nrecogniz j property in man. In what does that\nproperty consist ? Simply, in such services as\na man, or a child may properly be required to\nrender.' This is all the Levitical Law, or ny\nother law means, when it says, 'your bondsmen\nshall be your possession, or property and an in\ninheritance for your children.'\nAccording to this definition, it is not the man,\nbnt the service, that constitutes the property.\n'Chattels personal,' simply means services, and\nnot ;nen! Whenever a slaveholder sells a 'chat\ntel,' he sells the services, hut not the man, be\ncause the man is not property. Slaveholders\ndo not oira men, but services 1\nThis, certainly, is a distinction, not only with\nout a difference, but also without an intelligent\nmeaning, when applied to 'chattel slavery.' Let\nus consider its consistency before we adopt it\nas a standard definition.\nFirst : If rendering \"sucA services' ss may be\nproperly required of man, is all that slave laws\nmean by 'chattels personal,' then wherein does\nthe 'bondage' consist ? And wherein does a\ncommon laboring man, who renders 'such servi\nces a may properly be required.' differ from a\nslave T Are we to infer, that ull employers are\nslaveholders, nnd all working men slaves f\nSecond : If slavery with an iron grasp, holds\non to the ntin. while it grinds out the property,\nor service, then how does this definition help\nthe poor victim of oppression, or viudicate the\nmorul churacter of slnvery 1 Is the slave less\nmiserable and degraded, or slavery less oppres\nsive and wicked in the sight of God and man f\nWe object to this definition, when applied to\nslavery, not only because it is a -blinder,' and\ncalculated to mislead honest men, and vindicate\nluvery ; but because it is untrue both in fact\nand principle, and is contradicted by every Blave\ncode on earth. Did the Roman laws which\nclaimed the right and power of life and death,\nover the slave, consider the service, and not\ntlie slave, property T The right to kill a man\nfor his services, is a strange right 1 The Ame\nrican slave code, most emphatically declares\n'That a slave is one that belongs to his master,'\nHint 'slaves snail ne aeemea soiii, tuken, repu\nted and adjudged in law to be 'chattel person\nal.' in the hands of their owners, to all intent,\nconstruction and purpose whatever.' If the\nlanguage of this code does not mean that slaves\nare property, then law cannot express the idea\nof proper in anything.\nBut while this deuniuon is utterly irreconcila\nble with the claims of slavery, it nevertheless\ndeuls a death-blow to all the pretended support,\nthat slavery derives from Hebrew servitude, not\nwithstanding the claim set op fur divme authori\nty. Mr. Van Dyke informs us, that 'All the\nLevitical law, or any other law means, when it\nsays 'your bondsmen, shall be yoir possession.\nor property, and an inheritance Tor your child\nreu,' is that their services, such services as a\nman may properly be required to render,' con\nstitute the property 1 Of course, then, Hebrew\nservants were not slaves, either iu tbe Roman\nor tbe American sense of the word; ao i to as\nsume it is a perversion of Scripture.\nBut, notwithstanding, Mr. Van Dyke's plau\nsible definition of 'property in man,' I ratber\nsuspect from his quotations and expositions of\nthe 'Levitical Iaw,' that when we come to the\nbottom line of his system, we shall find slavery ;\nthat 'property in service, is ouly a new name\nfor an old sinner wbo wishes to escape by de\nnying his identity. Indeed, after quoting from\nLeviticus, Mr. Van Dyke says in so many\nwords,' know, from tht plain passage, I have,\nquoted, and many more like it, that he (God)\ndid sanction slaveholding among hi ancient peo\nple, 4c. p. 9. So then by the sort, gentle terms\nproper services' we are to understand slavery\nwith its chattelism and involuntary servitude\nforever. Huw he know that God sanctioned\nslaveholding among the Jews, while multitude\nas competent and candid deny it, may be a ques\ntion for modest inquirers.\nMr. Van Dyke does not go back to Noah's\ncurse upon Canaan for evidence of slavery, as\nmany others nave uone I ior aoet ne stop to\nconsider the case of Abraham, wbo is usually\nrerarded by our opponents as tbe Prince of\nOld Testament Slaveholders ; but merely says.\n'Passing by the records of the Patriarchal age,\nand waiving the question as to those servants\nin Abraham's family, wbo in the simple, but ex\npressive language of scripture 'wer bought with\nhis money' let us come at once to the tribunal\nof that luw, which God promulgated amid the\nsolemnities of Sinai.' He then gives as the\nlaw, astound in Lev. xxv. 3941 aud 44, 43,46,\nverses.\n'And If thy brother that dwelletb by thee be vuaa poor and\nbe eold unto tbae, thou ahalt not compel him to aerveaaa\nIvmd tmni, but aa a ajrea1 rra4 and aaojouruer be ahall be\nwith thee and atuall aerve thee unto the year of Jubilee, and\ntheo aball be depart fioin thee, both be aud bia ehUdroa with\nbin..'\nThus far tbe law defines the relations of Jew\nish servant. They are said to be told, yet are\nto serve as 'ir-servuts.' Tbey were by right\nfree at the end of six years, yet might compel\nihoir masters to keep tbem longer. Now a these\nHebrew servants were free before they were\nsold, the question arises, wbo SolJ them. I an\nswer, tbey sold themselves, iu Other words, con\ntracted their service. Of course then every\nthing wa voluntary, and there was do slavery\nBut let os consult tbe Levitical Law\n.T.'T.4t,.4' 4 1,n'n trv Knndmen and thr bond,\nnvlla, which thou alialt have, rhall he of the heathen that\nre round alm.,t ynn.

And ye ahall take them aa\nan Inheritance for ynnr children after you, to Inherit tbein a\npoaaeulon they ahall be your bondmen forever.'\nIn these passages we find the full relioble\nstrength of the pro-slavery, scriptural argument.\nThese are among the grand proof-text to vindi\ncate American Slavery on divine authority. If\nthese do not prove that slavery is a scriptural\ninstitution, then there is no proof in the Bible.\nThe simple question, is do these passages, or\nany others, teach the existence of Chattel\nSlavery,' in the American sense of the word ?\nWere the Jews slaveholders under the provi\nsions of ibis Law, and their slaves property ?\n1 am aware, that some anti-slavery writers\nspeak of Jewish servitude, as a mild form of\nSlavery, and or bondmen, as sla ves. But they\nwholly deny the chattel element, unless in speak\ning of criminal or captive taken in war. I\ntake the American definition, as the true one.\nand affirm that God neither gave sanction, nor\ntolerated 'chattel slavery' in the Hebrew Com\ntnonwealtb j nor did the nation ever practice\nit, unless after they apostatized, and theo God\nrejected them.\nIt is a striking fact, that there is no word in\nthe Hebrew language for ilave ; bence the\nTranslators never use the word in translating.\nHence, no word synonymous with tlave, ever\nentered into the Hebrew code. Had God no\ndesign in thus carefully excluding such a word.\n'Bnt, surely, say the advocates of slavery, the\nword 'Bondmen' is eqnivolent to tlave and muni\nmean the same thing.' Theargnmentof Mr. Van\nDyke for Hebrew slavery, seems to be based,\nmainly, on the conclusion that 'bondmen and\nslove' are synonymous terms.\nThis I deny. And this Mr. Van Dyke does\nnot attempt to prove by a single criticism, or\nallusion as to the use, or meaning of the origi\nnal word I Had he faithfully told his bearers,\nthat there it no Hebrew word for slave, that the\nword translated bondman,' is also translated\n'tervanf and denotes any one serving iu any ca\npacity, it might have Created some doubts as\nto the soundness of bis conclusions. Kuppose\nI call attention to the lauguageof the Levitical\nluw, as quoted\nFirst : I give a literal translation of the He\nbrew text, by 'a citizen of Virginia, a geutleman\nof candor and acholarship.'\nVerse 44 And thy man-eervant and tliy maiden which\nahalt be to the (hall te from the nationa which aurmtind\nyou. From tbem ball ye procure (the) man aervant jind tbe\nmaiden.'\nVerse 4S 'And aim Imm the anna of the foreigner, and the\natranjrera amonr you, Irom Ibem ahall ic proenre nun from\ntheir famtiiea which (are) among you, which they brnupht in\nto your laud, and (tbey) nball be to you for a poHaeaeioiu'\nVerae 48 And ye ahall poeea them youraelvea lor vour\naona after you, for to pnapeM (ai l a naeid n . Forever of\nthem ahall ye aerve yonraelvea. And over your brethren, tbe\nanna of larael, man towarda h la brother, thou ahalt not rule\noverwiOj ilgor.'\nIn this translation, tho words enclosed in\nparenthesis, are not in the original, but are sup\nplied to render the reading more natural to the\nEnglish reader. Tbe words. eveJh and amav.\ntranslated 'bondmen' and 'bondmaids' in the\ncommon translation, are both in the singular\nnumber in the Hebrew and in the sixth verse of\nthis same chapter are translated 'servant' and\n'maid,' and should have been so translated in\nthis verse, instead of 'bondmen' and 'bondmaids.'\nThe word translated 'heathen' should be render\ned 'nation' as more literal and true to tbe ori\nginal. But let us examine the import of the word\nbondman' more critically and see if it is synony\nmous with the word 'tlave,' or will admit of\nsuch an interpretation, lhe word slave is\ndefinite, and always means one and the same\nthing, unless used figuratively. Technically, it\nmeans a literal slave, one in bondage, such as is\nimposed by the American slave code. When\nwe speak of men as 'slaves to lust,' or 'passion,'\nor when we bear the slaveholders taunt 'white\nslaves of the north,' no candid person under\nstands that literal slave are intended. The\nword 'tlave' therefore and its significance is well\nunderstood, and no intelligent person is in dan\nger of confounding it with something else,\nsome other relation, or condition. Slave means\nslave, and literally, nothing else, it is tho legal\nword for 'chattels personal.' The Hebrew em\nployed one word to denote servitude of any\nkind, and that word was ebcdh, correctly and\nproperly translated 'servant.' This is the word\nthat our translators render 'bondmen.' Now\nto attach the idea of slave to this word would\nnot only be false in fact but absurd in theory.\nSuppose we give a few examples of the use of\nthis word and render it slave. Juduh when\npleading before Joseph for Benjamin is made to\nsay, 'Now therefore when I come to thy slave.\nmy father, &c.' But was Jacob the slave of\nPharaoh T Again 'let thy slave abide instead\nof the lud, a slave to my Lord.' So, the Queen\nof Sheba speaking of tbe officers of Solomon's\nCourt is made to say according to this version ;\n'Happy are these tby staves which stand con\ntinually before thee.' Saul's officers and sol\ndiers must be his slaves, David is Jonathan's\nslave, Abigail is David's slave, and so of a\nmultitude of cases where minister's and worship\npers of the true God and men in every variety\nof service miiot be slaves ; if tbe word transla\nted 'bondmen' means slave 1 Yet this is the\nkey-stone in the arch of Bible slavery. Had\nthe Hebrew word been translated servant, as it\nshould have been, slavery would never have fled\nto the Levitical Law and seized upon the word\nbondman' in order to vindicate 'chattel slavery,'\nThe translators being familiar with a system of\n'villeinage' peculiar to their country and wish\ning to express a difference between 'hired ser\nvauts' of Jewish birth, and servants of other\nnations, under longer contract of service, and\nperhaps less favored, used the term 'bondmen ;'\nbut never with a thought of expressing 'chattel\nslavery,' or tliey would bave used tbe word\nslave, instead of tbe equivocal term 'bondmen.'\nBut, we are told, these boudmeu' were 'bought\nwith money,' therefore they must bave been\nslaves, or property.\nThe word 'buy 'bought' 'bought with mo\nney,' &o. is very far from expressing the idea of\n'property in man' iu tbe sense of -chattelism.'\nThis tbe most common reader of tbe Bible may\nknow, simply by taking bis concordance and\nlooking out tbe word. The common Hebrew\nword is 'kaunau' and accord ng to Geseniua, the\nhighest authority, means 'to found, create, to\nget, gain, obtain acquire, potsest, vurchate, buy,\n4c' Wbo would ever think of deriving slave\nry from this word. But were person bought,\nslaye I It is (aid that Joseph 'bought the\nEgyptians,' during tbe severe lamiue. were\nthey his slaves f Jacob bought his two wives\nof Laban, their futher. Were they bis slave.\nBoax bouirht his wife. Rutb. Was she tbere-\nford bis slave T I might multiply examples of\nthe use of kaunau, to get, obtain, uoy, SO., in\ndefinitely ; but it is unnecessary, to convince\ntbe candid.\nIo the light of such criticisms, I now ask,\nwbat is tbat argumeut worth, that iufers \"chat\ntel slavery\" from the use of sucb word as \"buy,\nbought, bondmen,\" to. When we speak of a\ntlave, iu connection wit b the American system,\neverybody knows what we mean, without ask\ning ; for the word slave, io its literal sense, nev\ner means anything but a slave io the \"chattel\"\nsense and when we speak or buying man, or\nwoman, or person, it is syoonyomous with boy.\ning a slave ; and if we did not mean a slave io\nthe proper sense, it would be necessary to My\no. to Dreveot a misundurtaidieg.\nBut it if said, that ilisj ''bondmen\" to bought\nwere called tbe \"uxwter's money,\" ere\"po-\ntettlon\" and ao 'ntftiitance to their children\nforever. I answer, w heu Jew sb. hnvd-eervaoU\n\"old themselves,\" they went out tue at tbe and\nabout it.\nfurther.\nof six years. So the law decided. But a heath\nen miitht contract for a longer period, even for\nlife, or until the universal jubilee, which was\nonce in fifty year. Hence, his term of contract\nnot expiring during tbe life of the master, be\nbecome a possession aud inheritance for tbe\nchildren.\nII., I . T.. r. I.. ll.J L!\ndefinition to Hebrew servitude, and not to slav\nery, and said that the \"money, or possession, or\ninheritance consisted in such services as a man\nmay properly be required to render.\" he would\nhsve been nearer the truth, and escaped tbe re\nbuke of the slave code.\nHe who lawfully held a servant, was entitled\nto his services his services were his property\nhis wages a possession, and dying, the services\nof that servant became the dower of his chil\ndren. This exposition is scriptural nnd natur\nal, and does not involve Ood and bis people in\n\"chattel slavery.\" But that Hebrew servitude\nand American slavery differ in their fundamental\npiinciples, and are consequently different sys\ntems, entirely unlike each other, \"is so palpable\nand evident, that even the Rev.

This concession\ndeals a death-blow to all claims set up for A mer\nican slavery based on the Old Testament, unless\nit can oe shown that tnnie ann heathen views\ndo not essentially differ, althoogb the Bible pro\nclaims and demands the riehts of men. while\nheathens deny and refuse them I Hence, Dr\nRaphall virtually admits what Abolitionists\nclaim, via : American slavery has on foundation\nin the Scriptures, because it is tbe heathen\nview of slavery 1\nHaving considered the meaning of those\nwords and phrases most relied upon, to prove\nthe existence of Old Testament slavery, and\nshown beyond successful contradiction tb'ti\nthey furnish no ronf, whatever, of 'chattel i\nslavery,' I now invite attention to some general\nfacts and principles, establishing my position.\nFirst. Abraham is claimed as a slavehold\ner, because he had servants who were 'bought\nwith his money' and 'born in his house'. We\nBod, on one occasion, Abraham arming 318\n'trained\" servants to rescue Lot, who had been\ntaken prisoner by certain kings. Now, if he\ncould arm 318, then his servants must have\nnumbered in all, counting families, some 1 500\nor 2000 souls. Does any man believe that these\nservants, were slaves, bought up, and born io\nhis bouse I In Gen. 12 : 5, we are told Abra\nham left Haran, with Sarai, his wife, and Lot.\nhis brother's son 'and the souls they hsd gotten\nin llarun.' Now these souls, were the servant\nthey had gotten in Haran. The Jerusalem Tar\ngnm and Chaldee Paraphrase say 'all the tout\nwhich he had subdued unto the law.' And when\nwe read '318 trained servants.' the Hebrew\nreads catechised servants.' These servants,\ntherefore, were protelytrt. who believed in Abra\nham's God and Religion. When Abraham\nleft Haran, they voluntarily went with him.\nHe had paid them a consideration for their ser\nvices. they were converts to his religion, and\nnow cheerfully follow him, as bis servants and\nsnbject ; bnt not as slaves. To suppose thut\nhe armed a gang of 318 slaves, and pursued an\nenemy, is sufficiently absurd without refutation.\nTbey most have differed very essentially from\nmodern 'chattels' or the old patriarch might have\nfound his troop marching iu quick time hack\n. . I I C I I -J.I ,1\nto taran. .ong oeu re ne reacneo tne nauieneia\nBut as subjects and servants, worshippers of\nthe same God and united to him by\ninterest, they were perfectly reliable.\nSecond. The Jews, themselves, were\nonce in bondage, or as some say slavery.\nBy looking into theipcondition, we may bet\nter understand the use of terms and the\ndifference between slnvery and servitude.\nWhile in Egypt, they are said to be in lie\nhouse of bondage,' they were Pharaoh's\nbondmen, 'Their lives made bitter with\nhard bondage,' they were under 'task\nmasters' and their condition is represented\nas 'hard' 'oppressive' and 'grievous.' Cer\ntainly, Hebrew servitude was no worse, nnless\nGod sanctioned in Canaan the oppression\nhe condemned in Egypt. But was Evp\ntian bondage 'chattel slavery' were the\nJews slaves 1st. The Jews were not scat\ntered among the Egyptian families 2J.\nThey owned the hind of Goshen, the very\nbest land in Ktcypt, and occupied it for a\na possession ail. I ney owneo docks ana\nherds and mnch cattle 4th. I hey lived in\npermanent houses and were well fed and\nclotbed-5th. They were all well armed\n6th. They worshipped their God without\nrestraint.\nDoes this look like American Slavery J\nIf Hebrew servitude imposed no'hing worse,\nthen, it was infinitely preferable to Amer\nicun Slavery Yet this was such bondage\nas God condemned, auifor the practice of\nwhich, the Egyptian were utieily over\nthrown. If American slavery is not sinful,\nthen I defy any man to prove that there\nwas anything wrong in Egyptian bondage;\nunless, what was wrong iu the dark ages of\nthe world, is ull right in the nineteenth cen\ntury. In order to test the claim of American\nSlavery, to divine sanction, I now pro\npose to compare the two systems Hebrew\nServitude and Americau Slavery.\nFirst. The Hebrews, or Jews, obtained\ntheir servants, by purchase, unless captives\ntaken iu war. Tho Hebrew code contains\nno record warranting tho conclusion, tbat\nciiminals were punished by bondage. Steal\nirfg and kidnapping men, was punished with\ndeath. Hence tbe only means of obtaining\nservants was to buy tbem. Tbia purchase\nwa a mutual, vuoluotary transaction. If\nservants were bought of the third person\nand carried by force, or against their will\ninto servitude, it would be oppression, or in\neffect, stealing or kidnapping. If stealing\nI taking without liberty wbat don't belong\nto os, then acquiring servants by force, or\nwithout their consent, must be stealing, so\nlong as man has a right to himself ; hence\nthe Jews bought their servauts.\nSecond. 1 am sorry to be obliged to say\nAmerican slaves, were originally acquired\nby kidnapping and theft, aud tbat we oow\nhold them as \"stolen goods,\" that is, re\nreivers. How was slavery established in\nthis country, and wbeu aud bow did we gel\nonr slaves f When our llev. casuist bat\ntle abolitionists for believiug that American\nslaveholdiug is sin, and ought to be abolish\ned, aa a means of qnickening their moral\ntierr-emions. wft recommend this feature of\nA ma, l.-nn aUterv to their consideration Par-\nbapu, if tbe African slave trade if s wheel\nid ft wheel, aud Ood's providence does work\n'\nI\nont a good, man' piracy rosy not be en\ndorsed, even if slavery Is.\nThird, instead of a fugitive slave law to\nreturn slaves, Ood passed one to aid and\nsecure tbeir escape. It reads as follows :\nPrrr. xxtll i IS. 18. \"Thou ahalt not deliver onto hi. maa-\ner the eervant which ta earmned from hia matr nnlo th.. ,\nbe ehall dwell with thee, even among yon in the plw which\nhe ahall chooee In one of the valea wliem It llkeih l.w ti .\nThou ahalt not nppreea him I\"\nAs coni-lusive evidence that he was not\na slave, or property, if the servant, wag not\nwell nsed, or did not like his master, he\nconld leave, and wo he to the man who de\nlivered him op to the master. This law\nprotected him in his rights, and proves that\nhe might quit the service of his master when\nwrongrd. The law is imperative. \"Thou\nshall not,\" &c. The evasion of this law by\na dinning that heathen were not permitted to\nsit ze their rnn-sways among; the Jew, is un\nworthy of consideration, as if Jews lived on\nsuch irood terms with the idolatrous nations\nj about them, or heathen would come among\ntbem looking for fugitive slaves.\nKorxTH. But the American code\n\" Thou shall deliver the servant.,\" &r. No\nmatter how much outraged, he is a chattel.\nand mast be delivered np, if the whole U.\nS. force is necessary : \"blood honnds \" and\nmore blood thirsty men. hunt him like a wild\nbeast of prey, and if they overtake him, he\nis doomed to heavier chains for even daring\nto fly from the oppressor, and from a bond\nage worse than death.\nFifth. Under the Hebrew code, nearly\none half of the time the servant was ex\nempt from labor, or about 23 years out of\n50. Hence he was never over-worked, and\nhad ample time for bis religion and social\nlife.\nSixth. Flow does this benevolent provis\nion accord with the American code. By\nsome, it has been said, that the average of\na slave's life on cotton plantations, was from\ntertn to ten years. Such is the wear and\ntear of slavery. A slave sees few days of\nrest, and brief are the periods for his reli\ngious devotion; while social life, where boa-\nhanils and wives, parents and children are\nbound together by no leiTa! tie. is a delusion.\nSeventh. The Hebrew code every fiftieth\nyear, passed a Universal Emancipation Act,\nin the following words :\nI.ar. ITT ! \"And re shall hallow the fiftieth rear and nen-\nelaim LihtrUi Ikrarngk mil tht land unf ai l the Inhabitants\ntnereoi : 11 atutii ne a jubilee nnto you, and ve aball return\nevery man unto hia poteeeatoa, nod re aball return every man\nMr. Van Dyke says the \"Abolitionists\nhave blown this jubilee trumpet with a zeal\nworthy of a better cause.\" This may ac\ncord with the views of such as defend slav\nery npon principle, lie then, in a few\nwords denies that the year of jubilee had\nany application to ' bondmen of foreign\nbirth,\" Then we are to understand, that\nwhen God says \"proclaim liberty through\nout all the land, onto all the inhabitants\nthereof,\" it only menus Jews, while others\nare to continue in bondage ! But the Jew\nish servants, we are told, went ont free\nevery seventh year, therefore did nof, need\nthe fiftieth year of jubilee. In Is. lvhi: 6,\nwe find instruction a-i to what constitutes\nan acceptable fast : \"Is not this the fast\nthat I have chosen, to loose the bonds of\nwickedness, to ondo the heavy burdens and\nto let the oppressed po free, and that ye\nbreak every yoke.\" But could the Jews\nbreak every yoke, while thousands of bond\nmeirwere still under i he yoke? Were none\noppressed but Jewish servants ? The year\nof jtlhiIee WM t0 end oppreon to hreilk\nJ ,. . , : ,., . '\nerery yoke, and proclaim liberty to all the\ninhabitants of the land. It is tbetefore ab\nsurd to soy it only referred to Jews, when\nGod says it refers to all the inhabitants of\nthe land. Such an interpretation is a sort\nof Judge Taney decision, denying citizen\nship to colored men.\nEh.htu. American slavery has no year\nof jubilee. It dooms the slave to ceaseless,\nendless bondage, till death emancipates and\nses him free.\nWo might notice other benevolent fea\ntures in the Hebrew code, proving it as nn\nlike the American system as noon day is\nunlike midnight. For example : Hebrew\nservants could not le sold ; American slaves\ncan be sold. Hebrew servants, when cru\nelly treated, were made free ; American\nslaves are never treed on account of abuse.\nHebrew servants were entitled to equal re\nligions privileges with the master ; Ameri\ncan slaves are to a great extent cut off\nfrom religious privileges. Hebrew servants\nwere carefully instructed in families, the\nsame as other members of the household ;\nAmerican slavery denies education to the\nslave, and makes it penal to teach htm to\nread or write. Hebrew servants enjoyed\nfamily relations ; American slaves do not,\ntheir wives and children may be taken away\nat pleasure. Hebrew servants could ou\nproperty ; American slaves can neither ac\nquire, or own anything.\nHaving thus far confined onr inquiries to\nMr. Van Dyke's \"Levitical Law,\" or Old\nTestament argument for slavery, I now call\nyour attention to his New Testament the'\nory, which may be more readily disposed of.\nNot that I have, by any means, exhausted\nthe overwhelming testimony of the Old,\nagainst slavery ; indeed, I have scarcely\nnoticed Ood's denunciation of oppression\nin every form, nor the precepts and teach\nings of that moral code whjch lays slavery\nunder an eternal ban. We have passed\nover the predictions of Isaiah, Jeremiah,\nand other prophets, whose language glares\nwith retributive wrath against tbe oppres\nsions of the poor, and sucb as torn aside\nthe stranger from his rights. Slavery is\ncursed and doomed from Genesis to Mnla\nchi, without a sentence, word, or syllable\nto show God's approval, or sanction of the\n\"chattel doctrine,\" as taught iu this coun-\nMM\nand all attempt to fatner u npon\n\" t . . i . L - A\nHebrew servitude owy prove- mo uw.a\ntion of a system, goaded to maduess by tbe\nlight and progress of the world\nMr. Vn Dyke's argument, drawn from\nthe New Testament, is a most remarkable\nexample of special pleading, far-fetched in\nferences, bold assumption, and consummate\ndogmatism. A quotation will illustrate it.\nAfter affirming that Uavery \"existed an\nover tbe civilized world\" when the Saviour\ncame, and was as \"common as it is to-day\nin South Carolina;\" aud after saying, \"It\nis not alleged by any one having any pre\ntension to scholarship or tandttr, that tbe\nlloinau laws regulating slavery vert even\nas mild as the very wortt statutes, which\nhave been ptssed upon tbe subject lo modern\ntime,' be asks,\nAnd bow did Jeaua and hie e-tlae treat unaeuojemr\nMe-tere and aUvee met tbu M every ah p la tbetr mlaauwarr\nj wwt ad pwi t ej eudjeoce bk- tr w.4\nd.

' ' 1\nI reRti this part of Mr.\nVan Dyke's sermon with astonishment, and\nwondered, if a New York or Brooklyn\nandience could be fonnd to endorse it, evert\nwhen heated np with secession excitement f\nor if country readers coold be found to be\nlieve it.\nI pass by the asnmption that slaver was\nso universal and common when our Saviour\ncame ; and that masters and slaves met\nChrist and his apostles at every step, ana\nwere present in every andience, to notice\nsome other glaring essertion.\nFirst. He says. 'It Is not alleged\nanyone, or at least, by any having any pre\ntentions to scholarship or canlor, tbat the\nIhman law regulating slavery, were even\nas mild as the very vorst siaUUtt which'\nhave been passed upon the snbject in mod\nern times.' Assumption, wholesale asser\ntion seems to he a favorite mode of reason\ning with Mr. Van Dyke, when on the sub\nject of slavery J Does he mean to assome\nhat all scholarship and candor resides in\nin the advocates of slavery 1 Or was he\nignorant of the fact that many men whose\nscholarship and candor have ranked quite\nhigh as bis own have maintained that\n'American Slavery is the vilest, that ever\nsaw the so n r J leaven only can measure\nthe enormity of Roman laws on the subject\nof slavery, if they were worst than any of\nmodern times. Mr. Rice, of Kentucky\nspeaking of the laws that confine the slave,\nsays they are 'consigned to a bottomless\ngnlf of wretchedness.' The Maryville Irf\ntelligencer SHys 'the condition of slaves ia\nthe southwestern states is second onh to\nthat of the wretched treaturain hell. The\nsynod of Kentucky says 'they svjfcr all that\ncan be inflicted by wanton caprice grasping\navarice, brutal lint, maligna t spite, and\nantanctr Now if Roman laws, and Ro\nman slavery, were still worse, then perdi\ntion, itself can hardly furnish a parallel of\nwretchedness. Ta-sing, I would1 as, .watt\nRoman slavery sinful, and those bad laws\nonly abuses J Did Roman laws regulating\nslavery, hold that 'men ttat fiof property\nonly his 'serrzeer were property.' If Christ\nand his apostles believed, tbat such slave-',\nholding was nnand onght to be abolished,\nwere they not Abolitionists ? Or did tbey\ndefend npon principle such slavery? Or\ndid their 'itMer silence' signify approval.\nSecond. After Mr. Van Dyke assumes,\nand claims all candid scholars, as agreeing\nwith him thatRomnn laws regulating slave'\nry, were not even ss mild as tbe Worst stat-'\nntes of modern times, be informs os, that\nalthough Christ and his apostles met it at\nevery step and in every audience, still they\nwere 'vtterly silent' in regard to the sinful-\"\nness of slaveholding. He tells ns, tbat the\ncondemned every ackwrwledgtd tin, in nn-'\nmeasured terms, 'drunkenness and adultery,\ntheft and murder' 'all the moral wrongs,\nwhich ever hnve been knowu to afflicted\nsociety, are forbidden by name,' and yet\nslaveholding 'is never spoken of except irJ\nrespect f ul terms .\" Then, according to Mr.\nVan Dyke's own showing modern statutes\nupon the subject of slavery are 'bad,' but\nRoman laws were 'worse.' If I understand\ncorammon English Grammar, comparison1\nruns in the direction of 'bad, worse, worst,\nand uot 'good, worse. So then we have,\nindirectly, at last, the coufession tbat, both\niu the Roman and American code tbere are\"\nbad lairs ; but although Roman laws gave\nslaveholders the power of life and death\nover the slave, still neither Christ not the\napostles ever alleged that slaveholding was \"\nsinful, bnt were utterly silent.' Let those .\nbelieve this who can. And we might add,\nif they were thus silent, what does it proveT\nTmnn. But, silence is the mighty argu\nment, when we approach the New Testa\nment with the question of slavery. Mr.\nVan Dyke says \"It is a remarkable fact,\nwhich the Abolitionist does not, becatfse he\ncannot deny, that the New Testament is\nutterly stL nl in regard to the alleged sinful\nness of slaveholding.\" Now, itf the first\nplace, I deny that any intelligent, sane Abo\nlitionist ever maintained, thtt the New\nTestament is \"utterly silent\" ort the sinful\nness of slaveholding. The precepts and\nteachings of Christ and the apostles af e Con-\"\ninitially leveled against this sirt by Aboil\ntiouM. lltnc, tor Mr. V an Dyke to as\nsert that Abolitionists admit the siltike\n\"utter silence\" of the New Testament in re\ngard to the sinfulness of slaveholding, be\ntrays an unaccountable ignorance of Aboli\ntionism or sotnethiag worse. It is repre\nsenting them as virtually yielding the Bible\nargumeut, while he onght to kurfw that the\nNew Testament has been the mighty wea\npon against slavery, in the bands of patriots,\nphilanthropists and christians, ia every age\nof the world, and that bit own church, by\niU Geuerul Assembly, boasts of being\namong the first in \"the good work of en\ndeavoring to pot an erUl to slavery,\" because\nto the \"Gospel of Christ.\"\nDIGEST, p. 343.\nBut suppose we should admit that Christ\nand the apostles were silent on the sin of\nslavebolJing, how does their silcuce prove It\nriirht f Such a rale of testimony would\nprove some of the most flagrant evils, siu\nless and right.\nFirst. At our Savior's advent ths Ha\ninan government was infected to its very\ncenter with Idolatry I Where did Christ\ndirectly ever say a word against Idolatry\nHe never named it once 1 By Implication\nof course, he condemned It ; but b was\n\"utterly silent,\" so far as any open rebuke\nor condemnation was concerned I Are wa\nto iufer that Idolatry was not sinful, be\ncause the Savior did not 0eiilv assault it I\nSecond In the time of Christ and his\napostles, every Roman father poesessed the\npower of life and death over bis child.\nWhen tbe child wat born, it was lor tho\nfather to say whether it should be reared or\nleft to die I If bo decided It should die.\nIt was left by ths roadside to perish, or to\nbe picked op by any ono who cared to ssvo\nit. Such conduct was Inhuman, opposed to\nthe law of God, tod the Gospel of Christ,\nBut where did Christ or the apostles ever\nopenly condemn U. They were 'uttor'j si\nlent ;' was U not therefore sinful?\nThird.

Charles Stelzle.\nIn some respects, modern slavery lias not been so extensive\nnor so horrible as that which existed in Greece and Rome, but\nthe story is nevertheless one which stirs the blood. Colonial\nslavery is a blot upon many a modern nation's history. In\ntwenty years during 'this period in America, 300,000 negroes\nwere exported to the United States. From 1080 to 17SG it is\nestimated that 2,130,(100 negroes were imported into all the\nBritish Colonies in America. Naturally great numbers of\nslaves died while in captivity before leaving Africa, and many\nmore died during the ocean passage. Probably only oiu-linlf\nof those captured survived the various stages of their transport\nation to America. There was the greatest recklessness in their\ntreatment, and the utmost indifference to their suffering.\nSlavery has been abolished in most countries, but it still ex\nists in the Mohammedan East, although usually only in house\nholds. While there is undoubtedly still some traffic in slaves,\nit is almost universally against the laws of the nations, and\nthose who engage in it do so contrary to the edicts of con\ngresses and parliaments which have been supported by practi\ncally all civilized peoples. In some countries a system of peon\nage is in vogue, which amounts to a practical slavery. But,\non the whole, the system of slavery no longer affects the laborer\nto such a degree that the workingnien suffer very materially\non account of it.\nIn discussing the question of the abolition of slavery, Mr.\nJ. Osborne Ward says, in ''Ancient Lowly:\"\n\"We shall submit that the religion of Jesus, planted bv a\nmanual laborer and forming the basis of hope upon which\nstands the great labor movement of our time, . . . has been the\npower, that openly struck the first well-organized blow at the\nsystem of masters and slaves, and boldly championed it as a\nprinciple; and in essence it has never since shrunk from its\nprodigious task toward realizing the much contested doctrine\nof human equality.\"\nFollowing the system of slavery came that of feudalism. Men\nhad passed through the hunting and fishing period. They be\ngan to settle on the land. They had learned how to till the sail.\nThey did not own it, but the \"land lords\" gave them the use\nof the property on condition of tribute or service. The lord\ngave them protection fr ;m the common enemy. This system\nwas developed principally from the lifth to the ninth century.\nThere were many forms of feudalism, conditioned upon the\nsituation prevailing in different countries and upon the char\nacter of the baron to whom the serfs gave tribute. The serf\nrarely paid any rent for the use of his bit of laud. His service\nto the baron in time of war or in other ways was his ordinary\ntax. With the development of the professional military class\nand the growth of city life through the grouping together of\nthe artisan and other classes, feudalism gradually disappeared.\nIn 1GG0 England, through Parliament, abolished land tenures.\nScotland followed in 1747. In France the revolution of 17S9\nbrought the same result; in Germany and Austria it was the\nrevolution of 1848-50 which accomplished its destruction. In\nRussia it was destroyed in 1861. Meanwhile, great changes\nhad been wrought, so that when the system was finally abol\nished, little of the original condition remained.\nDuring the period religious leaders who were -raised up from\namong the people fought against the svstem. They testified\nto the value of the individual. They taught that before God\nall men were equal. Says Thorold Rogers, in \"Six Centuries\nof Work and Wages:\"\n\"Wyclifs poor priests had honey-combed the minds of the\nupland folk with what may be called religious socialism The\npreachers told the people that 'it would be better for them to\ndie with arms in their hands than to be thrust back, without an\neffort on their part, into the shameful slavery from which they\nhad been delivered.' \"\nWoodrow Wilson of New Jersey has developed into a mighty\ngood friend of organized labor. He was its bitterest enemv for\nyears, but since he became the democratic candidate for gover\nnor of New Jersey he has seen a great light. :\nNebraska money spent for insurance premiums should be\nspent with Nebraska insurance companies.

IV UN BE It 22.\nFrom the Emncipator.\nSPEECHES AT THE ANNIVERSARY.\nPursuant to the notice (riven last week, we pro\nceed to publish the speeches delivered at the late\nAnniversary meeting ; that of Mr. Lee, from a copy\nfiirmshorl hv himself, and the others from the re\nporters of the New York Observer and Evangelist,\ncorrecting each by the other, and by our own brief\nnotes.\nGERItIT SMITH.\nGerrit Smith, Lsq. ot Peterborough, IN. i ., in\nmoving the acceptance and printing of the report,\nexpressed his hope that when printed, the report,\nwith all the important statements and convincing\narguments it coniained, might reach, every portion\nof our country. God, he said, would bless these\ntruths, and would give them efficacy on the minds\nof men, in spite of the spurious religion and spuri\nous republicanism which curse our land.\nMR. iuskin. ; .\nRev. John Rankin, of Ohio, seconded the mo\ntion. He said he had been brought\" tip in the\nmidst of slavery, and now lives on the borders of a\nFree State, where he was every hour looking over\nupon the land of oppression. All my life, said he,\nexcept seventeen years, has been spent in the slave\nStates, and no person has more kindly feelings to\nwards the slaveholding States than myself. There\nmy friends and kindred dwell. I speak the lan\nguage of kindness, and would do the utmost in\ntny power to persuade them to put away an evil\nwhich threatens their destruction. I must say 1\nrejoice in the triumph, of the principles of imme\npnni\ndiate emancipation, because\nI know, from lone\nobservation, it is tuc only tiling that can relieve\nboth master and slave from inevitable ruin. The\nsystem of slaveholding is calculated to bring ruin\nupon the country where it is tolerated ; and 1\nspeak the language of the South, when they speak\ncandidly. . I was a member of an Anti-Slavery So-cu-ty\nin Kentucky, Iweiily years ago, on the same\nprincple as this. The doctrine of immediate\nemancipation i3 said to be new; but societies were\nformed all over the country, twenty years ago, and\nmany members advocated the same doctrine. The\nslaveholders confessed that it was a ostein that\nwould bring ruin upon the country ; but when\nasked whv thev did not abolish it, they would\nsay, like llczckiah of old, \" it will not come now\nwe shall have peace in our day.\" Others said\nthey believed, with the assistance of the free Sta'cs.\nthey could hoW them forever. Vet we aie told,\nthefrce States have nothing to do with the subject.\nSlaveholders have told me, if separated from the\nfree States, they would be in the hands of the\nslaves entirely.\nWe feel the hand of oppression not only upon\nllie slave, but upon ourselves.- Where I live, my\nsoul is harrowed continually with the cruelties\ncommitted in sight of my house, where slavery ex\nists in its mildest form. There, slavery has some\ntimes caused our town to go in mourning. Here,\nlio related the case of a slave ferryman, who was\nsuddenly and without warning or preparation, sold\nfor $750, by his master, to go \" down the river,\" af\nter having agreed to set him free, and the money\nhad been raised for the purpose, because an oppor\ntunity of getting $200 more, so that he was sep\narated from his wife and children. The details\nof the case have been already published. While\nI continue to be a husband and a father I must\nstand up and protest against this evil.\nLaws have been passed in Ohio, imposing a\nfine of $500, or imprisonment, on any person who\nshall knowingly assist a slave to escape. There\nwas an aged mother who had been brought up in the\nPresbyterian church, and who sustained an unblem\nished Christian character for twenty years, who fell\ninto the hands of heirs, who, it is said, wished to lib\nerate her, but the guardians were determined to sell\nher, old as she was, into the cruel slavery of the\nSouth. She was obliged to fly. Now suppose\nthis sister in the church had come to me, and I\nhad assisted her to flee from her cruel persecutors,\nthe State would have fined me $500 or sent me\nto prison. Yet, I, as a minister of Christ, should\nonly have been doing what U enjoined by the gos\npel I preach. I am forbidden to do an act of char\nity I am commanded to do the very hing which\nthe Bible forbids mo to doto deliver the fugitive\nservant to his master. I should be bound to take\nthis sister into my house if she comes there ; and\nyet such is the effrontery of slavery, that they have\ncome over and demanded that we, who assist our\nbrethren, according to the requisitions of God's\nword, shall suffer bonds and imprisonment. I can\nnot, therefore, but rejoice in the success of this\nSociety ; and it shall have my prayers day and\nnight.\nKEV. LUTHER LEE's SPEECH.\n\" Resolved, That the system of American sin\nVery usurps the prerogatives of God, tends to blot\nthe divine image from the soul of man, degrades\nJiim from the dignified rank his Maker gave him\nin the scale of creation, and subverts all the so\ncial relations which God and nature have made\nessential in his earthlv allotment.\"\nMr. President, were I to attempt to give a brief\nbut comprehensive view of the sinfulness ot sla-\nvery, I would do it in the words of St. Paul to\nBar-Jesus, ' Thou full of all subtlety and mischief,\nthou child of the devil, thou enemy of all right\neousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right\nways of the Lord V and then I would answer the\nquestion in a thrilling and emphatic INU, mat\nwould make every heart feel that slavery, bad as\nit is, can be made no better. I have it not in my\nheart so much to undervalue the intelligence, mor\nal sense and humanity of this assembly, as to\nsuppose that they are pro-slavery in judgment,\nn heart, and in feeling, yet as there is a vast dif\nference between believing that slavery is wrong,\nand seeing and feeling how great a wrong it is, 1\ntrust it will not be considered a breach of charity\nto suppose that there may he many, now within\nthe sound of my voice, who have never consider\ned the masrnitude of this great sin. I wish then\nto be understood as not making the present effort,\nso much to convince you that slavery is wrong, as\nto cause you to see and feel the greatness of the\nwrong, that in its guilt it rises to heaven, and in\njts corruption It sinks to hell,\nThe resolution which I have had the honor of\npresenting, lays four distinct crimes to the charge\nof slavery, which I will attempt briefly to sustain.\ni. ine resolution charges slavery with usurp\ning the prerogatives of God. To be convinced of\nthis, I need only compare the requisition which\nuod makes upon Ins creatures with the assump'\nlions of slavery. The divine requisition is sum\nmed up in the first and great commandment, in\nthese words: ' lliou shalt love the Lord thy God\nwith all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with\nall thy mind, and with all thy might.' Now,\nnothing can be plainer than that slavery usurps\nwhat God has here reserved to himself, when it\nsays : ' A slave is one who is in the power ot a\nmaster, to whom he belongs. The master may\nsell him, dispose of his person, his industry and\nhis labor : lie can do nothing, possess nothing, nor\nacquire any Hung but what must belong to his\nmaster.\" ljnvmana Lint Lode, art. 6o. Here\nit is seen that slavery sets up a claim to man which\ncontravenes the claim of God, it seizes upon the\nsubjects of God's moral government, and wrests\nthem from Ins administration, and subjects them\nto the will of n despot, who is not satisfied with\ntrampling upon the rights of man, but who arro\ngantly attempts to wrest the reins of government\nfrom him whose throne is in the heavens. Ihe\nclaim of slavery equals the claim of God, it claims\nthe whole man, and asserts its absolute right to\nthe whole soul and body, mind and muscle, all\nthat the man is, all that he can do, all he can pos\nsess, and all that. he can acquire, and what more\nthan this can God claim ? Have these human\nhattels souls that must be forever saved or lost?\nand can they do nothing in the work of saving or\ndamning their souls, but what must belong to their\nmasters ? Suppose they obey God, so far as cir\ncumstances will permit, and through Jesus Christ\nacquire eternal life, will that belong to the master ?\nand will he appear at the judgment seat and claim\nthe crown by virtue of his title to the slave, who\n' can do nothing, possess nothing, nor acquire any\nthing but what must belong to his master V Or\nsuppose the slave to be as wicked as his master,\nand 10 live and die a child of the devil, and an\nleir of hell, will the master appear and take the\nf 1 fi t . I '1.1.\nnacres oi sin as ins own : n may oe saici mat\nnothing is meant more than that slaves can do,\npossess and acquire nothing of a temporal nature\nbut what must belong to their masters. I know\nthis is what is meant, but I know with equal cer\ntainty, that man's future destiny depends upon\nwhat he does and possesses in this life. Christ\nrepresents himself as saying at the last day, ' Come\nye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom pre\npared for you from the foundation of the world,\nfor I was an hungered and ye gave me meat, na\nked and ye clothed me, sick and ye visited me, in\nErison and ye came unto me. Inasmuch as ye\nave done it unto one of the least of these my\nbrethren ye have done it unto me.' And again\nhe says, Depart ye cursed into everlasting fire, j\nprepared for the devil and his angels, for I was an\nhungered and ye gave nie no meat, I was thirsty,\nand ve gave nie no drink, I was a stranger and\nve took me not in, naked and ve clothed me not,\nsick and in prison and ye visited me not Verily\nI say unto you, inasmuch as ye did it not to one\nof Ihe least of these, ye did it not to me.\"\nNow, I ask, can those who can do nothing but\nwhat must belong to another, visit the sick and\nthose in prison ? Can those who can possess noth\ning and acquire nothing but what must belong to\nanother, feed the hungry and clothe the naked ?\nV ou all know they cannot, and hence you see that\nslavery disqualifies men for subjects of God's\nmoral government, it denies them the means ol\ncomplying with the first precepts of the gospel,\nit therefore contravenes the claims ot Liod, and\nsets at nought the great law of our being, which\nholds all intelligent creatures in allegiance to the\nthrone of the Creator. If this is not high trea\nson against the government of God, treason i3 a\nnonentity. If it is not trespass upon the prerog\natives of God, it can never be proved that the dev\nil has committed trespass in the case ol all the\nsouls he has seduced from their allegiance to the\ndivine throne, for he never claimed more of man\nthan slavery claims, and never received more from\nthe most accomplished and zealous nena mat ever\nserved his cause, disembodied or incarnate ; no,\nnot on the black throne of hell, wielding a scep\ntre of unmingled despotism over unblessed ghosts\nwhose ruined immortality exerts its perverted en\nergies under cover of that dark night of despair\nthat mantles the damned. Mow great a sin is\nslavery ? It is the sum of all sin, it is a monopo\nly of crime '. For a worm of earth, a man, to at\ntempt to throw off his own allegiance to his Ma\nker is an awful thought ; but awful as it is, it is\nas much below the crime of slavery, os he who\nwould simply expatriate himself from his govern\nment, is less chargeable with treason, than he,\nwho instead of expatriating himself, should at\ntempt to expel his sovereign for the purpose of\nseizing the throne himself. The common sin of\nrefusing to obey is outdone and lost in the blacker\nshades of the slaveholder's guilt, who not only re\nfuses to obey himself, but refuses to let others\nobey, seizing upon the subjects of God's moral\ngovernment, and, usurper-like, attempts to reign\nin the place of the Almighty. It must be seen\nfrom this, that slavery usurps the prerogatives of\nGod, and that so far as slavery prevails, the gov\nernment of God is blotted from the world.\nII. Slavery is charged in the resolution with\na tendency to blot the divine imago from the soul\nof man.\nSo far as the image of God, in which man was\ncreated, consisted in the rectitude of his character\nas a moral leing, I shall not now discuss the sub\nject, for so far the divine image must be lost be\nfore slavery could exist ; for none but fallen and\ndepraved beings would ever be found in the rela\ntion of master and slave. To know what consti\ntuted the image of God, in which man was made,\nwe ueod only inquire what distinguished him from\nthe lower creatures; for it appears to me that\nwhatever the image was, it distinguished man as\nmore emphatically the offspring of God, and con\nstituted the difference between him and the brute\ncreation. What then distinguished man from the\nbrutes t\n1. While brutes were made wholly of inferior\nelements, with spirits that tend downward, man\nclaims affinity with the heavenly world, God hav\ning superadded to his earthly nature a living soul,\nwhich he infused of his own immortal breath.\nNow, it must be admitted that slavery can never,\nin point of fact, blot this feature of the divine im\nage from the soul of man, by making him any\nthing but an immortal being; yet it overlooks his\nimmortality, and treats this undying spirit as tho'\nit were mere matter, having no higher origin than\nthe earth, and looking forward to no higher .desli\nn y than the brutes; that perish.\" This immortal\nbeing, this living soul, which God kindled in man\nwith the quenchless fires of his own immortality,\nwhich is to return to its author to dwell with God\nforever, to sing with nngels, and swell the loud\ntriumphs of heaven and the glories of the throne ;\nor sink in endless perdition, as a fallen spirit un\nworthy a higher sphere :- this being is made \"a\npersonal chattel to be bought and sold, is made an\ninstrument of gratification to the hell-born passions\nof ambition and fust, is yoked with the brute, and\ndriven through life by the sting of the task mas\nter s lash like tho ox that perishes, as though\nthere were no heaven for the negro beyond the\ndelusive dream that intrudes itself upon his short\nhours of slumbering repose, so soon disturbed by\nthe well known sound of the horn that summons\nhim to a renewal of his toils, and as though there\nwere no hell for him to shun beyond the limits of\nthe cotton-held, the sugar-planti tion or the rice\nswamp.\nWhile God created the brute animals with\nnothing to rule their spirits and guide their ac\ntions but the impulse of an instinctive nature, he\nendowed man with the more noble faculty of\nreason, and thus formed him nfier the model of\nhis own nature, who is the only being in the uni\nverse possessing reason in absolute perfection.\nNow it is too plain to need proof that slavery la\nbors to keep the enslaved in ignorance, and even\ntries to extinguish the lamp of reason with which\nGod lit up the soul of man. Slaveholders admit,\nyea, contend that human beings cannot be held in\nslavery without being also held in ignorance, and\nhence no provision is made for the instruction of\nslaves; yea, more, laws are enacted to prevent\ntheir instruction under heavy penalties, and every\neffort possible is made to shut out light and to\nclose every avenue to the soul, lest one enkindling\nray should lighten and ignite the dark spirits ol\nthe enslaved, lhus you see that slavery does all\nit can to blot the image of God from the soul of\nman, by degrading him, in point of intelligence,\nas' nearly as may be, to a level with the brutes,\nWhile the lettered master boasts of his knowledge,\npressing onward in the course of science and phi\nlosophy, until he makes the heavens the play\nground of his thoughts, and regales himself with\nflowers plucked from the pathway of revolving\nworlds, he imposes the blackest ignorance upon\nthe spirits he holds in bonds, suffering not one\nbeam of light to fall upon their rayless orbs ;\nspirits by God himself made capable of constant\nand endless improvement, destined to blaze and\nshed their light upon the spheres of a cloudless\nworld, are by the very system ol slavery consigned\nto a night of ignorance as black as the brow of\ndespair, and as perpetual as the roll of successive\ngenerations.\nIII. The resolution charges slavery with the\ncrime of degrading man from the dignified rank\nwhich his Maker gave him in the scale of crea\ntion. God placed man over the work of his hands,\nsaying, ' let him have dominion over the fish of\nthe sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the\ncattle, and over all the earth.' This glory and\nhonor, with which God crowned his new-made\ncreature man, slavery plucks from his brow, it dis\nmantles him of the authority which his Creator\ngave him, and with its profane and heaven-provoking\nhand, hurls him down from the sphere as\nsigned him by God himself, and gives him a\nplace among the brutes that perish. It should be\nremarked that the authority with which God\ncrowned the first man, to subdue, rule, and possess\nthe world, belongs equally to all men, for it was\nconferred equally upon all men in the person of a\ncommon father. God hath made of one blood\nall nations of men to dwell on all the face of the\near'.h,' and it was when the blood of all men, the\nblood of the whito and black man, flowed undis\ntinguished in the veins of a common father, and\nrushed through its arterial way at the pulsations\nof the same undivided heart, that God bestowed\non him the right to possess and rule the world, and\nhence, this right of possession and control belongs\nequally to all men without distinction of color or\nnation. This right is evidently wrested from man,\nfor the law of slavery declares that he can pos\nsess nothing, which is so far from suffering him to\nrule any part of the world, that it will not sutler\nhim to rule himself, no, not his own limbs, but\ncompels him to submit them to act as they are act\ned upon by the dictates of another's will. God\nsays, as much to the black man as to the white\nman, 'Have dominion over the fish of the sea,\nand over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle\nand over all the earth,' but slavery says, ' Not so,\nLord, he can do nothing, possess nothing, nor can\nhe acquire any thing but what must belong to his\nmaster,' and which tells the truth, God or slavery,\nI will leave you to judge.\nIV. Slavery is charged in this resolution with\nthe crime of subverting all the social relations\nwhich God and nature have rendered essential to\nman's earthly allotment,\nMan is a social being, his Maker formed him\nfor society and gave him a nature which claims re\nciprocal enjoyments from kindred spirits ; hence,\nwherever man is found, he is known to exist in\nsome kind of society, and taste- though loo often\nwith a savage appetite, the sweets of friendly in\ntercourse. God having created man to exist in a\nsocial state, he has given us rules by which we\nshould be governed in our intercourse with each\nother, but slavery!, tramples upon these rules, and\npours its full cup pfj wormwood and gall into the\nvery fountains of human society. I cannot par\nticularize, but will note one or two points as speci\nmens of the whole.\n1. Slavery annihilates the matrimonial institu\ntion. This lies oi '! very foundation of society,\nit is the fountain u In- !t ; nds out its living streams,\nand fertilize this :U world with the buds and\nflowers and rifli li trvi 't of social animation, This\ninslltation Is the- oUk-si known to man, its plan was\nlaid by Gad himself when he declared, It is not\ngood that the man should be alone,' it was estab\nlished when God,1 having formed a woman, bro'l\nher to the man and presented a bride fair and in\nuocent in the lietit ot the lirst morn, ana it was\nfirst celebrated in Eden's undefiled bowers, ere de\npravity had corrupted the fountains of the heart, or\none blush ol guilt had reddened the countenance\nserene. , And God,, having instituted matrimony,\nChrist says, I-or this cause shall a man leave hi\nfather and his mother, and shall cleave unto his\nwife, and they twain shall ba one flesh, therefore\nthose whom God hath joined together let not man\nput asunder;' and yet slavery does this ; it lavs its\nunholy hands upon the bridal pair & rends them as\nunder as though God had not joined them together.\nBut it may be a question with some whether there\nis any such thing as matrimony among slaves. I\nknow there is not, there cannot be, so far as matri\nmony is to be regarded as a legal contract, but are\n.1 1 -I I r f, i . r. r i\nuiey marneu in uie sigiu oi uou s do lar as this\nargument is concerned, it matters not whether thev\nare married or not, for I will take a position which\nwill make the argument good in either alternative\nI say, then, they are married or they are not ; if\nt'ley are married, then slavery parts those whom\nGod hath joined together ; and if they are not\nmarried, then slavery annihilates the institution,\nand so far as the three million of slaves are con\ncerned, the entire south is one scene of corruption,\npollution and rottenness. Take which horn of the\ndilemma you please, and the argument is (rood :\nsay that slaves are married, and you charge sla\nvery with parting husbands and wives, and of ma\nking twain of those whom God has pronounced\none i or say that slaves arc not married, and you\ncharge slavery with the entire subversion of a di\nvine institution. I repeat, take which horn of the\ndilemma you please, cither will hang up slavery\nto the contemptuous gaze of all who have pure\nand virtuous eyes, and to be pierced by the liery\narrows of God Almighty's law.\n2. Slavery annihilates the obligation growing\noutol the relation subsisting between parents and\nchildren. The command of God is, ' Children.\nooey your parents m the lord.and ye lathers, pro\nvoke not your children to wrath, but train them\nup in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.'\nGod says, Children obey your parents in the Lord,\nbut slavery says, No, not so, Lord, they must obey\ntheir masters who own both parents and children.\nand have the right of separating them forever by\nselling the one at auction and the other by the\npound. 1 he son is robbed of all interest in his\nsire out of whose loins he came, is denied all right\nof obeying him during Jhe years of his minority,\nor of assisting him in the riper years of his man\nhood ; he cannot even reach out his hand to wipe\nthe tear from his grief-furrowed cheek, or to sup\nport his faltering limbs as he is hastened down\nlife's declivity by the sting of the driver's lash.\n1 he daughter has no right to obey her mother.\ncannot administer to the comfort of her who in\nanguish gave her being, cannot pour one drop of\nconsolation into that grief-charged bosom from\nwhich she drew her first nutriment, and at which\nshe was nurtured and reared from helpless infan\ncy to endure the woes of riper years.\nParents are also denied the right of responding\nto the obligations due to their offspring. God\ncommands parents to ' train up their children in\nthe nurture and admonition of the Lord,' but sla\nvery says, No, parents, ye shall not train up your\nchildren, or if you do, it shall not be for yourselves\nnor for the Lord, but for me, that I may sacrifice\nyour sons on the altar of my avarice, and your\ndaughters upon the altar of my lust.\nThus you see that the resolution is true to the\nvery letter: Slavery usurps the prerogatives of\nGod, tends to blot the divine image from the soul\nof man, degrades him from the dignified rank his\nMaker gave him in the scale of creation, and sub\nverts all the social relations which God and nature\nhave rendered essential to his earthly allotment.\nBut though I think I have sustained the resolution,\nyet I feel that I have come far short of giving a\n\"full view of the sinfulness and horrors of slavery :\nI have only discovered to you the points of the\nserpent's forked tongue ; the body of the viper, in\nhideous form, still lies concealed and i known in\nthe ever-abiding miseries, and dark horrors of the\ncotton field, the sugar plantation, and the rice\nswamp, from which I have not attempted to draw\nthe veil, Let no one think that I have given an\nexaggerated view of the subject; exaggeration is\nimpossible, the reality transcends the power of fic\ntion, and every nttemptnt declamation lessens the\nsublime horror of slavery. To describe it would\nrequire words that should, at the same time, shriek\nwith terrors of death, shade with the night of des\npair, and glow with the fires of hell. Q could I\nwake the winds of the south, and cause them to\npour into the ears of this assembly, the sighs and\ngroans and shrieks of tortured fathers, and tortur\ned mothers, and tortured sons, and tortured daugh\nters, I should need no other argument, for such\nsighs and groans and shrieks, coming up from the\ndark land of slavery, and concentrating at this\npoint, would howl in the ears of the assembly in\nnotes as wild as the cheer of assembled ghosts.\nBut I must forbear, or my indignant soul will sub\nstitute execration for argument, whereas Michael,\nwhen contending with the devil, brought not a\nrailing accusation against him, but said, The Lord\nrebuke thee ; and may the Lord rebuke slavery :\nrebuke it as Christ rebuked intruding devils, with\na rebuke that sent them back in scampering haste\nto their native hells, and may it not, like the eject\ned legion, be permitted to enter into the swine, but\nbe driven naked and unattended down the gulf of\neverlasting chaos and oblivion, never more to lilt\nits serpentine head this side of the bourne that di\nvldes this from the world of wo. Let it be blotted\nfrom the polluted records of the church, let it lie\nblotted from the disgraced annals of the State and\nNation, ic if it must have an enduring pnjjc assign\ned it on which to write its dark crimes, let it be\nin tho biography of some damned ghost, or in the\nhistory ot Beelzebub the prince of (he devils, ,\n11ES DR.

He followed\nslavery through the Old and New Testament,\nalong \"the coast of Africa, through the horrors of\nthe middle passage, among the plantations of the\nsouth, in its demoralizing effects upon the public\nmind at Washington and elsewhere, and snowed\nthat it was evil, and only evil, and that continual,\nly, loathed in the eyes of God, and detested by\nall moral aud godly men. The whole second ta\nble of the decalogue, he said, proceeded on the\nprinciple that man has a right to himself.

The\ncart had no covering, and they semed to have been\nactually broiled to sleep.

Letter XI. p. 117.\n\" It may be thought by some that the elevated\nseat in the cabinet, of a gentleman who expresses\nhimself with so much warmth and fearlessness\nagainst one of the 'peculiar institutions of the\nSouth,' militates against our idea that the infl.ii\nence of the Federal Government is exerted, in bt-.\nhalf of slavery.

Solomon Foot, of Vermont,\nwas elected Chairman, and the Hon. Daniel\nMace, of Indiana, and the lion. Reuben E.\nKenton, of New York, were appointed Sec\nretaries. A committee appointed for the purpose\nreported an address to the people of the\nUnited States, which, having byen discussed\nand amended, was unanimously adopted,\nand ordered to be published.\nTo People of the United States.\nTIip eighth section of the act for the ad\nmission of Missouri into the Union, known\nas the Missouri Compromise law, by which\nihe introduction of slavery into the regions\nnow l;nown as Kansas and Nebraska was for\never prohibited, has been repealed. That law\nwhich, in 1820, quieted a controversy which\nmenaced the Union, and upon which you\nhave o long reposed, is obliterated from the\nstatute book. We had no reason to expect!\nsurli proposition when we assembled here!\nmonths ago, nor did you expect it.\nno citizen of any State, had demanded\nthe repeal.\nIt seems a duty we owe to the country to\nsutiH uie groimus upmi mmiuu vte nave sie au-1\nf.istly. though ineffectually, opposed\nalarming and dangerous act.\nYou need not be told that the slavery i\nliiHstion lies nt the bottom of it. As it was!\n;ho slaveholding power that demanded the\nnactment of the Missouri Compromise, so\nit is the same power that has now demanded\nits abrogation.\nAfrican slavery was regarded and de\nnounced as a great evil by the American\ncolonies, even before the revolution ; and\nthose colonies which are now slaveholding\nStates, were equally earnest in such remon-\nst ranees with those which are now free,\nstates. Colonial laws, lramed to prevent\nthe increase of slavery, were vetoed by the\nKing of Great Britain. This exercise of ar\nbitrary power to enlarge and perpetuate a\nystein universally regarded as equally\nwrongful in itself and injurious to the colo\nnies, was one of the causes of the revolu\ntion. When the war was ended there was an\nimperious necessity for the institution of\nsome government in the then unoccupied\nenitories of the United States. In 1784,\nJefferson proposed, and in 17S7 the Conti\nnental Congress adopted the ordinance for the\ngovernment of the territory lying northwest\nof the Ohio, by which it was declared that\n'here thall be neither slavery nor involuntary\nservitude except for the punishment of\ncrime. The great and flourishing States\nsince organized within that territory, on the\nbasis of that ordinance, are enduring mon\numents of the wisdom of the statesmen of\nthe revolution.\nThe foreign slave trade was regarded as\nthe source of American slavery, which it\nwas believed would be dried up, when that\nfountain should be closed. In adopting the\nConstitution, it was 60 universally antici\npated that the foreign slave trade would be\npromptly prohibited, that all parties acqui\nesced in astipulation postponing that meas\nure till 1808. The foreign slave trade was\nprohibited thus the source of slavery was\nunderstood to be dried up, while the intro\nduction of slavery into the territories was\nprohibited. The slavery question, so far as\nit was a national one, was understood to be\nfinally settled, and at the same time the States\nhad already taken up and were carrying for\nward a system of gradual emancipation.\nIn 1803, Louisiana was acquired by purchase\nfrom France, and included what is known\nas the States of Louisiana, Missouri, Arkan\nsas and Iowa, and the territories known as\nKansas and Nebraska Slavery existed at\nthe time in New Orleans and at St. Louis,\nand so this purchase resulted in bringing the\nslavery question again before Congress. In\n1812, the region immediately surrounding\nNew Orleans applied for admission into the\nj\nTHE PERRYSBURG JOURNAL.\n131\nUnion, under the name of the State of Lou\nisiana, with a constitution tolerating slave\nry, and the free States acquiesced. Eight\nyears afterward the region connected with\nSt. Louis demanded admission under the\nname of the State of Missouri, with a con\nstitution tolerating slavery. The free States\nreverted to the principle of 1787, and op\nposed the admission of Missouri, unless she\nwould incorporate into her constitution an\ninhibition of the further introduction of\nslavery into the State. The slaveholding\nStates insisted upon her unqualified ad\nmission. A controversy arose which was\nsectional and embittered, and which, we are\nassured by contemporaneous history seriously\nimperilled the Union. The statesmen of\nthat day in Congress settled the controversy\nby compromise. By the terms of this com\npromise the free States assented to the ad\nmission of Missouri with her slaveholding\nconstitution, while the slaveholding States\non their part yielded the exclusion of slavery\nin all the residue of the territory which lay\nnorth of 36 deg. 30 min., constituting tire\npresent territory of Kansas and Nebraska.\nThe slaveholding States accepted the com-\npromise as a triumpti, ana trie tree states\nhave ever since left it undisturbed and un-\nquestioned. Arkansas, a part of the terri-\ntory of Louisiana, which lay south of 36\ndeg. 30 min., in compliance with an impli\n;my cation which was contained in this compro\nsix Nojmise, was afterwards admitted as a slave\nState, holding State, and the. frpp. States arnni-\n'esced. ' !\nIn 1819, Florida, a slaveholding provincej\nin apain, was acquired, inis province was\nthis;afterwards admitted as a slaveholding State,\nThe free States again acquiesced. In 1815,\nTexas, an independent slaveholdine state.\nwas annexed, with a provision in the article\nof annexation for the sub-division of her\nterritory into five States. The free States,\nalthough they regarded the annexation, with\nthe probable increase of the number of slave\nstates, with very great disfavor, nevertheless\nacquiesced again. New territories were ac\nquired by the treaty of peace which closed\nthe war with Mexico. The people of Cali\nfornia formed a constitution prohibiting\nslavery, and applied for admission into the\nUnion. Violent opposition was made by\nthe slave states in and out of Congress.\nthreatening the dissolution of the Union if\nOalilornia should be admitted. Proceeding\non the ground of these alarms, Congress\nadopted another compromise, the terms of\nwhich were, that ten millions of dollars of\nthe people's money should be given to Tex\nas to induce her to relinquish a very doubt\nful claim upon an inconsiderable part of\nNew Mexico, that New Mexico and Utah\nshould be organized without an inhibition\nof slavery, and that they should be after\nwards admitted as slave or free States as the\npeople, when forming constitutions, should\ndetermine ; that the public slave trade in\nthe District of Columbia should be abolished\nwithout effecting the existence of slavery in\nthe district ; and that new and rigorous pro\nvisions for the re-capture of fugitive slaves,\nof disputed constitutionality, should be\nadopted, and that on these conditions Cali-\nfornia should be admitted as a free State\nRepugnant as this compromise was to the\npeople of the free states, acquiescence was\nnevertheless practically obtained by means\nof solemn assurances, made on behalf of the\nslaveholding States, that the compromise\nwas and should be forever regarded as a final\nadjustment of the slavery question, and of\nall the issues which could possibly arise out\nof it. Anew Congress convened in Decem\nber 1851. Representatives from the slave\nstates demanded a renewed pledge of fidelity\nto this adjustment. It was granted by the\nHouse of Representatives on the following\nterms :\nResolved, \"That we recognize the binding\nefficacy of the compromises of the constitu\ntion, and believed it to be the intention of\nthe people generally, as we hereby declare it\nto be ours individually, to abide by such com\npromises and sustain the laws necessary to\ncarry them out, the provisions for the deliv\nery of fugitive Blaves, and the act of the last\nCongress for that purpose included ; and that\nwe deprecate all further agitation of ques\ntions embraced in the acts of the last Con\ngress, known as the compromise, and of\nquestions generally connected with the in\nstitution of slavery, as unnecessary, useless\nand dangerous.\"\nA few months subsequently, the Demo\ncratic National Convention met at Balti\nmore, arid assuming to speak the sentiments\nof the Democratic party, set forth in its\nplatform : That the Democratic party will\nresist all attempt at renewing, in Congress or\nout of it, the agitation of the slavery ques\ntion under whatever shape or color the at\ntempt may be made. Soon afterward anoth\ner national convention assembled in the\nsame city, and assuming the right to declare\nthe sentiments of the Whig party, said :\n\" We deprecate all further agitation of the\nquestions thus settled as dangerous to our\npeace, and will discountenance all efforts to\ncontinue or renew such agitation, whenever\nor however made.\" The present administra\ntion was elected on the principle of adher\nence to this compromise, and the President,\nrefering to it in his inaugural speech, de\nclared that the harmony which had been se\ncured by it should not be disturbed during\nhis term of' office. The President, recurring\nto the same subject, renewed his pledge in\nhis message to Congress at the beginning of\nthe present session, in the following lan\nguage :\n\" But notwithstanding differences of opin\nion and sentiments which then existed in\nrelation to details and specific provisions,\nthe acquiescence of distinguished citizens\nwhose devotion to the Union can never be\ndoubted, has given renewed vigor to our in\nstitutions, and restored a sense of repose and\nsecurity to the public mind throughout the\nconfederacy. That this repose shall suffer\nno shock during my official term, if I have\nthe power to avert it. those who placed me\nhere may be assured.\"\nUnder these circumstances, the proposi\ntion to repeal the Missouri Compromise was\nsuddenly and unexpectedly made, by the\nsame committee on Territories, which only\nten days before had affirmed the sanctity of\nthe Missouri Compromise, and declared the\nend of agitation in the following explicit\nand unmistakeable language.\n\"Y'our committee do not feel themselves\ncalled upon to enter into a discussion of\nthose controverted questions. They involve\nthe same grave issues which produced the\nagitation, the sectional strife and the fearful\nstruggle of 1850. As Congress deemed it\nwise and prudent to refrain from deciding\nthe matters in controversy then, either by\naffirming or repealing the Mexican laws, or\nby an act declaratory of the true intent of\nthe constitution, and the extent of the pro\ntection afforded by it to slave property in\nthe territories, so your committee are not\nprepared now to recommend a departure\nfrom the course pursued upon that memora\nble occasion, either by affirming or repealing\nthe eighth section of the Missouri act, or by\nany act declaratory of the meaning of the\nconstitution in respect to the legal points in\ndispute.\"\nThe abrogation has been effected in pur\nsuance of the demand of the administration\nitself, and by means of its influence in Con\ngress. In the House of Representatives, that\nbody which is more immediately responsible\nto the people, the contest was more equal\nthan in the Senate; though it is due to jus\ntice and candor that it should be stated, that\nit could not have been carried in either house\nwithout the votes of the representatives from\nthe free states. The minority resisted the\nattempts to arrest discussion upon this grave\nquestion, through a struggle of longer dura\ntion than any other known to Congressional\nhistory. Some attempt was made to stig\nmatize that minority as \" factionists,\" yet\nwe fearlessly declare that throughout the\ncontest they resorted solely to the powers\nsecured to them by the law and the rules of\nthe House, and the passage of the measure\nthrough the House was effected through a\nsupervision of its rules by the majority,\nand the exercise of a power unprecedented\nin the annals of Congressional legisla\ntion. The deed is done. It is done with\nclear proclamation by the administra\ntion and by Congress, that the principle\nwhich it contains extends not only to Kan\nsas and Nebraska, but to all the other terri\ntories now belonging to the United States,\nand to all which may hereafter be acquired.\nIt has been done unnecessarily and wanton\nly, because there way no pressure for the\ni-eurasita,\norganization of governments in Kansas and\nTTl. i ?.i u;t . .\nneuner oi wmcn territories con\ntains one lawful inhabitant who was a citi\nzen of the United States, and because there\nwas not only no danger of disunion appre\nhended, but by this reckless measure the iree\nStates have lost all the guarantee for freedom\nin the territories contained in former com\npromises, while all theStates, both slave and\nfree, have lost the guarantees of harrnony\nand union which these compromises afforded.\nIt seems plain to us that, fatal as the meas\nure it in these respects, it is only a cover for\nbroader propagandisni of slavery in the\nfuture, The object of the administration,\nand of many who represent the stave States\nis, as we believe, to prepare the way for an\nnexing Cuba at whatever cost, anil a like\nannexation of half a dozen of the States ot\"\nMexico, to be admitted also as slave States\nThe acquisitions are to be made peaceablv\nit tney can oe purcnasea at tne cost oi hun\ndreds of millions. If they cannot be made\npeacefully, then at the cost of a war with\nMexico, and a war wih Spain, and a war\nwith France, and at the cost of an alliance\nwith Russia scarcely less repugnant. Unmis\ntakeable indications also appear of a pur\npose to annex the eastern part of St. Domin\ngo, and to subjugate the whole island, restor\ning it to the dominion ot slavery and this\nis to be followed up by an alliance with\nBrazil, and the extension of slavery in the\nvalley of the Amazon. It is for you to judge\nwhether, when slavery shall have made these\nadditions to the United States, it will de\nmand unconditional submission on the part\nof the free states, and failingin that demand,\nattempt a withdrawal of the slave States\nand the organization of a separate empire in\nthe central region of the continent. From\nan act so unjust and wrongful in itself and\nfraught with consequences so fearful, we\nappeal to the people. We appeal in no sec\ntional spirit. We appeal equally to the\nNorth and to the South, to the free States and\nto the slaveholding States themselves. It is\nno time for exaggeration or for passion. an:l\nwe therefore speak calmly of the past, and\nwarn you in sober seriousness of the future.\nIt would not become us, nor is it necesr\nsary, to suggest the measures which ought\nto be adopted in this great emergency.\nFor ourselves we are ready to do all that\nshall be in our power to restore the Mis\nsouri Compromise, and to execute such\nfurther measures as you in your wisdom shall\ncommand, and as may be necessary for the.\nrecovery of the ground lost to freedom, and\nto prevent the further aggressions of slaverv.\nSOLOMON FOOT, Chairman.\nDaniel Mace, . .\nReuben E.

That means that it has the solid\nbacking of the whole employed class. No doubt\nthere is an understanding tHat the capitalists will\nstand by each other when they get in a fight on\naccount of this program.\nThat the bosses are acting upon this program\nis shown by the issues which have developed in\nrecent strikes. There has been a stiffening of the\nbackbone on the part of the employers, and in\nplace of following the policy of compromising and\ncoming to an agreement at the earliest possible\nmoment after the development of a strike, they\narc standing like a stone wall against any com\npromise on any of the essential points of their\nprogram to enforce industrial slavery.\nFight on in C leveland.\nThis is indicated very clearly in two strikes\nwhich are underway in Cleveland. The pattern\nmakers have been out for about four weeks and\nthe journeymen tailors have just gone out. Both\nthese organizations have had things pretty much\ntheir own way in their industry in recent years.\nThey are both stronj? craft union which have\nenforced the closed shop, and wage increases\nwhenever they have made a stand. Now they sud\ndenly find themselves up against a fight against\nthe open shop. Evidently the National Chamber of\nCommerce program is being put into effect.\nThese strikes and other of a similar character\nin other cities are but the first skirmishes in the\nbig battle which the united capitalist class if to\nfight to put labor back in ts place. The period of\neasy victories, whr.h the workers won through\nout the war period ,is over. Unemployment is on\nthe increase. Hard times are on the way. With\nthe coming of the industrial crisis and growing\nunemployment the conditions favorable to a vic\ntory for the bosses are being created.\nPlan to Reduce Wages.\nIf the bosr.es put over their program of in\ndustrial slavery there will be a general reduction\nof wages and the eight hour day will go into the\nscrap heap. The good old days when the boss\nhadn't the slightest hesitation of acting his part\nof the czar to the limit will return.\nHow are the workers going to meet this pro\nposition? Aie they going into the battle against\nthe united bosses a few companies at a time, as\nthe patternmakers and journeymen tailors men\ntioned above are doing, to the beaten piecemeal ?\nAre they going to fight as crafts and have their\norganizations smashed one at a time?\nThat is the kind of fight the bosses want. That\nkind of fight makes victory certain for them.\nIf the workers are to beat the bosses program\nof industrial slavery they will have to mobilize the\nunited power of the workers against the united\npower of the bosses. The shop organization, shop\ncommittee and industrial and community council\nsystem will accomplish that.\nThe Way To Fight.\nThe way to begin the work of uniting the\nworkers is for the live workers in every shop to\nget together and form a voluntary shop committee\nfor then- shop and begin agitation for a shop or\nganization and a shop committee elected by the\nshop organization.\nThe shop committee of an industry should be\nunited in an industrial council in which sit dele\ngates from every shop of the same industry in\nany industrial centre and the industrial councils\nfor the various industries should be united in a\ncommunity council, in which sit delegates from\nevery industry in the community.\nWith such an industrial organization the work\ners can meet the united bosses and their program\nof industrial slavery in a fight to the finish and\nwin.\nThe struggle is already underway. The time\nfor action is at hand. They way to act is to start\nwork in your shop to ORGANIZE A SHOP COMMITTEE.","18":"PAGE 4\nTHE TOILEK\nSATUKDAY, OCT. 16tb, 120\nThe Death of a Social System\nBy S. Macaulay\nIn his book, \"The Economic Consequences of\nthe Peace,\" J. M. Keynes, at one time a represent\native of the British Treasury at the Paris Peace\nConference, has the following passage:\n\"In continental Europe the earth heaves and\nno one but is aware of the rumblings. There\nit is not just a matter of extravagance or\n\"labor troubles\"; but of life and death, of\nstarvation and existence, and of the fearful\nconvulsions of a dying civilization \"\nThere is a possimistic note in Mr. Keynes' writ\ning which is perhaps natural to one who has not\nexperienced the keen pleasure of arriving at the\nsolution of the riddles and paradoxes presented by\nthe economic chaos of Europe.\nMr. Keynes may have heard of Marx, but he\nsays nothing in his book to indicate that he has\nconsidered the application of Marx's theories. The\nremedies he proposes are of the usual type put for\nward by the bourgeoisie, and futile.\nIn one point, however, Mr Keynes is in\nagreement with Marx; he speaks of the death of\"\na civilization. Socialists have pointed out, have\nbeen pointing out for the last half century, that\nsocial systems have no permanency, that they rise\nand fall with the changes produced by the improve\nment in the methods of production. The case in\npoint is hardly the death of a Civilization; it is\nthe demise of a social system, and the demise is\nclosely connected with the birth of a new system.\nI propose, therefore, to substitute the expres\nsion \"social system\" for the world Civilization.\nThe History Of Class Struggles.\nThe history of the human race has been a\nhistory of class struggles, the manifestations of\nwhich have been different in different countries,\nand under different economic conditions. But there\nhas (since the institution of chattel slavery) al\nways been the confliction of interests upon which\nthe class struggle is based.\nAssyrian, Chaldean, Egyptian, Greek, Roman,\nAztec economic history all present the same spec\ntacle of rise and fall. What is the canker that lay at\nthe root of them all, that lies at the root of the\npresent system? What is the common factor of\nunsoundness?,\nIt is SLAVERY. The enslavement of one class\nby another.\nBut why, it will be asked, should slavery be a\ndisintegrating force? Is it not true that thousands\nof slaves were not only contented, but happy as\nslaves? It is perfectly true. The position of the\nchattel slave of the old days was infinitely better\nthan that of the industrial slave of today; his\nmaster was also his owner, he had a personal in\nterest in keeping him in good repair, the.slave was\nan investment of so much money, and so must be\nlooked after. But the slavery of the wage-worker\nis a different type; it is a concealed slavery; it\nhas the appearance of freedom; the slave is not\nbound to one master, he is the slave of a CLASS,\nhe belongs to a slave CLASS.\nThe industrial slave of today is driven at a\nrate unknown in the days of chattel slavery; the\ncut-throat competition for markets compels an in\ntensification of exploitation Which makes the life\nof the chattel slave appear a holiday in compari\nson. It is this very intensification which is at the\nroot of the \"industrial unrest\" which is making\nitself manifest in all capitalistically developed\ncountries. Consciously or unconsciously, the slaves\nare' beginning to feel the gall-sores. They are be\ncoming class-conscious. In most cases they ,are in\nutter darkness as to both the disease and the re\nmedy, and it was not until Marx exposed the dis\nease that the remedy was also made plain.\n\"Concessions\" To The Workers.\nDuring recent jears the various Government s\nhave been frantically making concessions to the\nworkers. Unemployed insurance, old age pen-\n-i!i, profit sharing, etc. etc., hayc boon the\nsops thrown to the \"animals\" to pacify them.\nBut. they refuse to be pacified. Distrust of Gov\nern me i it. ami Parliament, National Assemblies\nand Cabinets is oxmly expressed, and in some\ncases they have been overthrown. Disgust at\nthe futility of \"parliamentary action\" is plain\nly manifested in the strikes and resorts to in\ndustrial mas-s action which are prevalent.\nThese expressions of discontent on the part","19":"\u00bb\n#\n4\nTHE DEIAWARPMOLmONKT.\nDEVOTED TO EMANCIPATION IN DELAWARE.\nTOL. 2.\nWILMINGTON, DEL., DECEMBER 31, 1848.\nNO. 14.\nPublished monthly by the\nAnti-Slavery Society.\"\nAll communications lor the paper and letters'\nrelating to business post paid and directed to\nthe \" Delaware Abolitionist,\" will be attended\nto.\nDonations may be sent to Rachel Basset,\nTreasurer.\nTerms 25 cents per year in advance.\nEdited by a Committee.\nDelaware v\nI\nLETTER TO THE PEOPLE OF THE\nUNITED STATES.\nBY THEODORE PARKER.\nSTATISTICS AND HISTORY OF SLAVERY,\nwill first call your attention to the Statis\ntics and History of Slavery.

Thus Ohio,\nIndiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, ami\nIowa, have been without any legal slaves Irorri\nthe beginning.\nIn the South the character of the people was\ndifferent ; their manners, their social and po\nlitical ideas were unlike those of the North.\nThe Southern States were mainly colonies of\nadventurers, rather than establishments of men\nwho for conscience' sake fled to the wilder\nness. Less pair.s were taken with the educa\ntion\u2014intellectual, moral, and religious\u2014of the\npeople. Religion never held so prominent a\nplace in the consciousness of the mass as in\nthe sterner and more austere colonies of the\nNorth. In the Southern Stales\u2014New Jersey,\nDelaware, Maryland, Virginia, the Carolinas,\nand Georgia,\u2014Slavery easily found a footing\nat an early day. It was not at all repulsive to\nthe ideas, the institutioos and habits of Geor\ngia and South Carolina. The other Southern\nStates protested against it;\u2014they never.\nConsequences follow causes : it is not easy\nto avoid the results of a first principle. The\nNorthern States, in all their constitutions and\nsocial structure, consistently and continually\ntend to Democracy\u2014the government of all,\nfor all, and by all;\u2014to equality before the\nState and its Laws; to moral and political\nideas of universal application. In the mean*\ntime the Southern States, in their constitution!\nand social structure, as consistently tend t*\nOligarchy\u2014the government over all, by a few^\nand for the sake of that few to privilege!'\nfavoritism, and class-legislation ; to conven\ntional limitations ; to the rule of force, and\ninequality before the law. In such a state of\nthings when Slavery comes, it is welcome.\u2014\nIn 1787, South Carolina and Georgia refused to^\naccept the federal Constitution unless the righk \"\nof importing Slaves was guaranteed to then#\nfor twenty years. The new States formed ill\nthe Southern parallels\u2014Kentucky, Tennessee^t\nAlabama, Mississippi\u2014retaining the ideas and\nhabits of their parents, kept also the institu\ntion of Slavery.\nAt the time of forming the Federal Consti\ntution some of the southern stat\u00e8smen were\nhostile to Slavery, and would gladly have got\nrid of it. Economical considerations prevailed\nin part, but political and moral objections to it\nextended yet more widely. The Ordinance of\n1787, the work mainly of the same man who\ndrafted the Declaration of Independence, pass\ned with little opposition. The proviso for sur\nrendering fugitive slaves came from a northern\nhand. Subsequently opposition to Slavery, in\nthe north and the south, became less. The\nculture of cotton, the wars in Europe creating\na demand for the productions ol American\nagriculture, had rendered slave labor more\nI\nsi\na\nfurevar prohik\nthat institution. Besides.\na\nto\nto\nto\nto\nin\nv aluable. The day of\nwas more distant and forgotten.\nown oppression\nSo in 1802,\nwhen Congress purchased from Georgia the\npart of her territory, it was easy for\nh to extend Slavery over that virgin\nsoil. In 1803, Louisiana was purchased from\nFrance; then, or in 1804, when it was ojgani\nzed into two territories, it would have been\neasy to apply the Ordinance of 1787, and pre\nvent Slavery from extending beyond the origi\nnal thirteen States. But though some provis\nions restricting Slavery were made, the ideas\nof that Ordinance w\nwestern\nthe Soul\nforgotten. Since that\ntime five new States have been formed out of\nterritory acquired since the revolution;\u2014\nLouisiana, Missouri, Arkansas, Florida, Texas,\nall Slave States,\u2014the last two with constitu\ntions aiming to make Slavery perpetual. The\nlast of these was added to the Union on the\n22d of December, 1845, two hundred and\ntwenty-five years after the day when the Fore\nfathers first set foot on Plymouth Rock ; while\nthe sons of the Pilgrims were eating and\ndrinking and making merry, the deed of An\nnexation was completed, and Slavery extended\nover nearly 400,000 square miles of new terri\ntory, whence the \u00bbemi-barbarous Mexicans had\ndriven it out.\nSlavery might easily have been abolished at\nthe time of the Declaration of Independence.\nIndeed in 1774 the Continental Congress, in\ntheir celebrated \"non-importation Agreement,\"\nresolved never to import or purchase any\nafter the last of December in that year.\nIn 1775, they declare in a \"Report\" that it is\nnot possible\nreason to believe that the divine Author of our\nexistence intended a part of the hu\nto hold\n\"\np\np\nsi a\n\u00dc\nfor men who exercise' their\nrace\nbsolute property in and unbounded\nIndeed the Declaration\npower over others,\nitselt is a denial of the national right to allow\nthe existence of Slavery : \" We hold these\ntruths to be >r\na ted equal; that they a*-e endowed by their\nCreator with cerla\namong these are [the right to] life, liberty, and\nthe pursuit of happiness;\u2014that to\nrights governments are instituted among men\nfrom the consent of\nlimit, that, all\nurialienable rights, tint\nMire these\nderiving their just pow\nthe governed.\"\nBut the original draft of this paper contained\na condemnation yet more explicit: 11 He [the\nking ol England] has waged cruel war against\nhuman nature itself ; violating its most sacred\nrights of life ami liberty in the persons of a\ndistant people who never offended him ; capti\nvating and carrying them into slavery....Deter\nmined to keep open a market where men\nshould be bought and sold, he has prostituted\nhis negative for suppressing every legislative\nattempt to prohibit or restrain this execrable\ncommerce.\" This clause, says its author him\nself, \" was struck out in compliance to South\nCarolina and Georgia, who had never attempt\ned to restrain the importation of slaves, and\nwho. on the contrary, still wished to continue\nit. Our northern brethren also, I believe, felt\na little tender under these censures; for though\ntheir people have very few slaves themselves,\nyet they had been pretty o msiderable carriers\nof them to others.\"\nThese were not the sentiments of a single\nenthusiastic young Republican. Dr. Rush, in\nthe Continental Congress, wished M the Colo\nnies to discourage Slavery and encourage the\nincrease of the free inhabitants.\" Another\nmember of the American congress declared, in\n^779,\" Vlen are by nature free ;\"\nto be free can never be alienated.\"\nDr. Hopkins, the head of the New England\ndivines, declared that \" Slavery is, in every\ninstance, wrong, unrighteous and oppressive ;\na very great and crying sin.\"\nIn the articles of Confederation, adopted in\n1778, no provision is made for the support of\nSlavery ; none for the delivery of fugitives.\u2014\nSlavery is not once referred to in that docu\nThe General Government had nothing\no do with it. \" If any slave elopes to those\nstates where slaves are free,\" said Mr. Madi\nhe becomes emancipated b^4\nil\n\"\nthe right\nIn 1776,\nment.\nson in 1787,\ntheir laws.\"\nIn the Convention of 1787, which dralted\nthe present Constitution of the United States,\nthis matter of Slavery was abundantly discuss\ned ; it was the great obstacle in the way of\nforming the Union, as ndw of keeping it. But\nfor the efforts of South Carolina, it is probable\nSlavery would have been abolished by the\nConstitution. The South claimed the right of\nsending Representatives to Congress on account\nof their Slaves. Mr. Patterson, of New Jer\nsey, contended that as the slaves had no rep\nresentative or vote at home, their masters\ncould not claim additional votes in Congress\naccount of the slaves. Nearly all the\nspeakers in that Convention, except the mem\nbers from South Carolina and Georgia, referred\nto the slave-trade with horror. Mr. Gerry, of\nMassachusetts, declared in the Convention,\non\nthat it was \" as\npact with the slaves of the Southern States, as\nwith the horses and mules of the North.\" It\nwas contented^ th5t if slaves were men, then\nthey should bq taxed as men, and have their\nvotes as men ; iif mere property, they should\nnof entitle their owners to a vote, more than\nother property. It might be proper to tax\nslaves, \" because it had a tendency to discour\nage Slavery, but to take them into acoount in\ngiving representatives tended to encourage the\nslave trade, anti to make it the interest of the\nStates to contiaue that infamous traffic.\" It\nwas said, that \" we had just assumed a place\namong independent nations, in consequence ol\nour opposition to the attempts of Great Britain\nto enslave us; that this opposition was groun\nded upon the preservation of those rghts to\nwhich God and Nature had entitled us, not in\nparticular, but in common with all the rest of\nmankind. That we had appealed to the Su\npreme Being for his assistance, as the God ol\nheaven, who could not but approvp our efforts\nto preserve the rights which he had imparted\nto his creatures, that now, when we had\nscarcely risen from our knees from supplica\nting his aid and protection in forming\nernment over a free people,\nformed pretendedly on the principles of liber\nty, and for its preservation,\u2014in that government\nto have a provision, not only putting it out of\nits power to restrain or prevent the slave trade,\neven encouraging that most infamous traffic,\nand giving States power and influence in th\u00e9\nin proportion as they cruelly and wan\ntonly sport with'ihe rights of their fellow\ncreatures,\u2014ought to be considered as a solemn\nmockery of, and insult to, that God. whose\nprotection we h*d then implored, and could\nnot fail to hold us up in detestation, and render\nus contemptible to every true friend of liberty\nin the world.\"\nr ,\u00bbi hjcr Mn jp-ifcitii<s.atJo* ney-gen^rrtraT 1 r.l ary-\nland, thought it \" inconsistent with the prin\nciples ol the Resolution, and dishonorable to\nthe American character,\" to have the importa\ntion of slaves allowed by the Constitution.\nThe Northern States, and some of the South\nhumiliating to enter into com\na\n, wished to abolish the slave trade at once,\nin any short\nSaid Mr. Rutledge, of South Caiolina.\nto give up so important\nan interest.\" \"Religion and humanity have\nnothing iu do with this question.

Both parties seemed\nobstinate ; the question of \" Taxes on exports\"\nand of Navigation laws\" remained to be decid\ned. Gouverneur Morris recommended that the\nwhole subject of Slavery might be referred to\na committee \" including the clauses relating\nto the taxes on exports, and to the navigation\nlaws. These things may form\namong the Northern and Southern Stales.\"\nSays Luther\nStates, notwithstanding their aversion to Slave\nry, were very filling to indulge the Southern\nStates, at least i with a. temporary liberty to.\nprosecute the slajie trade, provided the South\nern Slates wouB in their turn gratily them\nby laying no restriction on navigation acts.\"\nThe North began to understand if tfce contem\nplated navigation laws should be enacted, that\na.\u00ab Mr. Grayson afterwards said, \"all the pro\nduce of the Southern States will be carried bv\nthe Northern Slates on their own terms,which\nmust be high.\" Mr. Clymer, of Pennsylva\nnia, declared, \" The Western and Middle\nStates will be ruined, if not enabled to defend\nthemselves against foreign regulations;\" will\nbe ruined if they do not have some navigation\nlaws giving Americans an advantage over for\neign vessels. Mr. Gorham, of Massachusetts,\nsaid \" the Eastern States had no motives to\nonion but a commercial one.\" The proffered\ncompromise would favor their commercial in\nterests. It was for the commercial interest of\nthe South said Mr. Pinckney, to have no re\nstrictions upon commerce, but considering\nthe loss brought on the Eastern States by the\nRevolution, and their liberal conduct towards\nthe views of South Carolina, [in consenting to\naIIuw Si\u2014- \u00bb- t: \u00bb\u00ab\u00abJ iijt- idMou or sieves.J\nfi\u00e9 thought that wo fetters should be imposed\non the power of making commercial regula\ntions, and his constituents would he retaiciled\nto the liberality.\" So the North took thehoon,\nand winked at the \" infernal traffic.\" When\nthe question was put, there were in favor of\nthe importation of slaves, Georgia, the two Ca\nrolinas and Maryland, with New Hampshire,\nMassachusetts and Connecticut.

Subsequently Mr. Antes, in\nthe Massachusetts Convention for the adoption.\nof the Constitution, said the Northern States\n11 have great advantages by it in resppet of na\nvigationj\" in the Virginia Convention Patrick\n, Henry said*, \" Tobacco will always\n\\\n\\\nj\na\n\u25a0\nI found the Eastern\nrtm,\nit w<\nke our\npeace with them,\" for at that time Cotton was\nimported from India, not having become a\nstaple of the South. When the article which,\nbinds the free States to deliver up the fugitive\nslaves, came to be voted on, it was a new fea\nture in American legislation ; not hinted at in\nthe \" articles of con ederaiion hostile to the\nwell known principles of the common law of\nEngland\u2014which always favors liberty\u2014and\nthe usages and principles of modern civilized\nnalions.

It \" was agreed to, nem. con.\"\nYet \" the Northern delegates,\" says Mr. Ma\ndison, \" owing to their particular scruples on\nthe subject of Slavery, dirt not choose the word\nslave to be mentioned.\" In the conventions\nof the several States it seems no remonstrance\nwas made to this article. ^\nLuther Marlin returning home, said to the^\nHouse of Delegates in Maryland, \" at this. 1\ntime we do not generally nold this commerce 1\nin so great abhorrence as we have done ; when m\nour liberties were at stake, we warmly felt for W\nthe common rights of men: the danger being^\nthought to be past, we are aaily growing more^\ninsensible to their rights.\nWhen the several States came to adopt the\nConstitution, some hesitancy was shown at\ntolerating the slave trade or even Slavery it\nself.
